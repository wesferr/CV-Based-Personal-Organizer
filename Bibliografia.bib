Kinect is a state-of-art stereo-camera that plugs into the USB port of a standard computer, and comes with Microsoft developed SDK to facilitate application development. The proposed system will provide necessary information on the object that the user is pointing at, such as its distance from the user's hand and the locations of nearby objects, from a database that is manually updated beforehand. The system is designed to help visually impaired persons to get used to a new indoor environment and explores the potential for applying Kinect to assistive technology in a broader way.},

The work relies on tracking a single object in an indoor environments and the knowledge extraction of a particular object is based on three preset measurement tools. The first tool is pixel location retrieval by calculating the center of mass for the object of interest. Second attribute extraction is based on the time spend by object of interest in each frame and in each predefined zones. Finally the third measurement approach is achieved by calculating the pixel frequency distribution of the object.

abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an automatic identification technology that can track and identify people, animals, and objects. It uses the radio frequency signal to send data from RFID reader to RFID tags. A common RFID system will involve RFID tag, RFID reader, and antenna as its components. Nowadays, RFID technology has been widely used for indoor positioning especially for the smart shelf in locating and tracking the object on the shelf. But, the existing smart shelf needs more than four antenna and more than two readers to increase the accuracy of locating the location and position of the misplaced item at the certain covered area. This research paper will compare a few algorithms which are Fingerprinting (Block Distance), Trilateration (Least Square Estimate) and Trilateration (Two-Border) to show the different accuracy among them and to increase the accuracy in locating the exact position of missing object by using Real Time Locating System (RTLS) by proposing a new algorithm. Besides, Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is the chosen method of getting data from different points of the shelf to find the location of the missing object on the shelf. This indoor positioning use reference tag technique to get the RSSI data from the shelf. Thus, we can identify the missing object and detect if there is misplaced object occur or track the real-time location of the object. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract = {Metal and nonmetal objects, buried to a selected depth in dry sand in an indoor sandbox, are illuminated by an impulse radar system playing the role of a ground penetrating radar (GPR). The recorded time-series data of backscattered echoes from these targets are analyzed in the joint time-frequency domain using a pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD). These distributions with their extracted features in the two-dimensional time-frequency domain are viewed as the target signatures. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of the PWD for target identification purposes, in particular the merits of the PWD relative to various competing time-frequency distributions for targets buried at different depths. We have also used a classification method developed from the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering technique to reduce the number and kind of features in the PWD signature templates. This is accomplished by converting the PWD signature into a representation by a cluster of points associated with a weight and then reducing the cluster to a number of (weightless) cluster centers. We investigate here how the selected number of cluster centers and the choice of a governing parameter in the FCM algorithm influence the target recognition capability of the resulting signature representations. The classification algorithm is tested against validation data taken from an additional set of returned echoes. The same targets are used but they are buried at a different location in the sand. Class membership of a target is then decided using a simple metric. The results of our investigation serve to assess the possibility of identifying subsurface targets using a GPR, by means of the present technique.},

abstract = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is considered as the main technological solution that will enable the aged and people in recovery to maintain their independence and a consequent high quality of life for a longer period of time than would otherwise be the case. This goal is achieved by monitoring human's activities and deploying the appropriate collection of services to set environmental features and satisfy user preferences in a given context. However, both human monitoring and services deployment are particularly hard to accomplish due to the uncertainty and ambiguity characterising human actions, and heterogeneity of hardware devices composed in an AAL system. This research addresses both the aforementioned challenges by introducing 1) an innovative system, based on Self Organising Feature Map (SOFM), for automatically classifying the resting location of a moving object in an indoor environment and 2) a strategy able to generate context-aware based Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) services in order to maximize the users' comfort and hardware interoperability level. The overall system runs on a distributed embedded platform with a specialised ceiling-mounted video sensor for intelligent activity monitoring. The system has the ability to learn resting locations, to measure overall activity levels, to detect specific events such as potential falls and to deploy the right sequence of fuzzy services modelled through FML for supporting people in that particular context. Experimental results show less than 20{\%} classification error in monitoring human activities and providing the right set of services, showing the robustness of our approach over others in literature with minimal power consumption. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Laser scanners are increasingly used to create semantically rich 3D models of buildings for civil engineering applications such as planning renovations, space usage planning, and building maintenance. Currently these models are created manually - a time-consuming and error-prone process. This paper presents a method to automatically convert the raw 3D point data from a laser scanner positioned at multiple locations throughout a building into a compact, semantically rich model. Our algorithm is capable of identifying and modeling the main structural components of an indoor environment (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doorways) despite the presence of significant clutter and occlusion, which occur frequently in natural indoor environments. Our method begins by extracting planar patches from a voxelized version of the input point cloud. We use a conditional random field model to learn contextual relationships between patches and use this knowledge to automatically label patches as walls, ceilings, or floors. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate windows and doorways. This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded regions and holes in the surface. Next, we use a learning algorithm to intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even when partially occluded. Finally, occluded regions on the surfaces are filled in using a 3D inpainting algorithm. We evaluated the method on a large, highly cluttered data set of a building with forty separate rooms yielding promising results.},

abstract = {Mobility of people with disabilities is one of the most important challenges for their social integration. There have been significant effort to develop assistive technologies to guide the PWD during their mobility in recent years. However, these technologies have limitations when it comes to the navigation and guidance of these people through accessible routes. This is specifically problematic in indoor environments where detection, location and tracking of people, and other dynamic objects that may limit the mobility of these people, are very challenging. Thus, many researches have leveraged the use of sensors to track users and dynamic objects in indoor environments. However, in most of the described methods, the sensors are manually deployed. Due to the complexity of indoor environments, the diversity of sensors and their sensing models, as well as the diversity of the profiles of people with disabilities and their needs during their mobility, the optimal deployment of a sensor network is a challenging task. There exist several optimization methods to maximize coverage and minimize the number of sensors while maintaining the minimum connectivity between the sensor nodes in a network. Most of the current sensor network optimization methods oversimplify the environment and do not consider the complexity of 3D indoor environments. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D local optimization algorithm based on a geometric spatial data structure that takes into account some of these complexities for the purpose of helping PWD in their mobility in 3D indoor environments such as shopping centers, museums and other public buildings. {\textcopyright} Ali Afghantoloee and Mir Abolfazl Mostafavi.},

abstract = {Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) are emerging computing systems that can locate objects or people inside indoor environment. This technology shows assurance for future mobile apps that can be used in malls, museums, hospitals, airports and college campuses for self localization. Despite advances in Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, indoor spaces are still out of reach of satellites. GPS signals are not designed to penetrate most construction materials. An IPS relies on nearby anchors or landmarks, and uses various sensing schemes including artificial vision, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Camera images etc. In this paper, we present a system that leverages the camera and Wi-Fi present in the smart phones carried by users, to track them as they traverse in indoor environments. It makes use of a radio map of an indoor environment. A significant challenge that our system surmounts is to estimate user's position without any prior user-specific knowledge, such as the user's initial location. The results obtained after conducting simulations demonstrate the validity and suitability of the proposed algorithm to provide a high performance level in terms of positional accuracy and scalability. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {While in the near future everything will be tagged with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, the localization of these tags in their environment is becoming an important feature for many RFID-based ubiquitous computing applications. The problem being tackled here relates to the problem of object location in wireless sensor networks, it is a specific problem in localization. Localization primarily refers to the detection coordinates of a node or an object. This work presents an approach named multidimensional scaling for estimating the location of unknown RFID tags, within the area to facilitate locating all tags in a RFID network and reduce the localization cost and environment complexity. It measures the distances between the reader and tags using the log normal distance path loss propagation model for indoor environment based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurement. The main advantage of this technique is reduction the number of expensive RFID readers and it can better tolerate noises. However, signals in indoor environments are generally harshly impaired because of multipath propagation and the variable factors in the surrounding environment, resulting in the tags have very limited capabilities which pose many challenges for positioning them. This work presents also the effect of propagation parameters on the localization accuracy by varying these parameters to observe the probability distribution of estimated distance, where the propagation parameters in indoor environments make working with signal strength measurements challenging. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Various geospatial data on same object cause problems with the financial problems and the suitability of the data. In the paper, we reviewed how to integrate existing geospatial data to utilize geospatial data constructed in different models and formats. There are four main ways to fuse existing geospatial information. The existing geospatial data fusion methods consist of a method through geometry data conversion, a method through the aspect of visualization, a method based on attribute data, and a method using topological relationships. Based on this review, we defined a geospatial data fusion method on topological relationships, which is a method considering topological relationship between geospatial objects. In this method, the topological relationship of objects uses the basic concept of IndoorGML. {\textcopyright} Authors 2018. CC BY 4.0 License.},

abstract = {As schemes for indoor positioning of persons and objects using near field communication and/or visible light communication come closer to reality, expectations are centering on the spread of indoor location-based services. A problem with these schemes is that they are costly because special equipment is often required for transmission and reception. As relative positioning schemes by controlling illuminance and color temperature of existing indoor lighting, this study proposes those using luminance and color temperature. Relative positioning schemes using luminance and color temperature rapidly estimate a relative position by switching multiple lighting patterns of a ceiling lighting system. By gradually adjusting luminance and color temperature for different locations, positioning is possible on the basis of the degree of change in sensed values. We implemented this relative positioning scheme using luminance and color temperature and evaluated the relation between the Euclidean distance and the real distance between sensors in a real space simulating an office. As a result, it was clarified that there was a correlation between the Euclidean distance and the real distances between sensors in 5 stages. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

It is a two stage method based on interpretation tree search approach and using straight line correspondences. In the first stage a set of matching hypothesis is generated. Exploiting the specificity of the mobile robotics context, the global interpretation tree is divided into two sub-trees and then two geometric constraints are defined directly on 2D-3D correspondences in order to improve pruning and search efficiency. In the second stage, the pose is calculated for each matching hypothesis and the best one is selected according to a defined error function. Test results illustrate the performances of the approach.},

abstract = {Worldwide museums have in common the intention of "telling a story", this intention is beyond value and size of the displayed pieces, its geographical location or the quantity of people that visit them. In this perspective, light fulfils a highly regarded double role: to reveal the object itself (physiological function) and "to generate ambience" (significance function) where the statement is produced and, therefore, it takes part of the statement in an implicit form. However, lighting together with other environmental conditions (like temperature and humidity), can modify objects' properties significantly throughout their exhibition time, leading to deterioration. Therefore there is always a dilemma to solve: Exhibition versus Preservation. High standards of preservation may lead to poor conditions of exhibition. On the other hand, a stimulating ambience for exhibition may expose valuable objects to lower preservation standards. This paper explores the relationship between the exhibition of artwork or historical pieces in museums and the role of lighting and other environmental conditions as generator of an ambience where a story is told. It presents surveys carried out in museums in Argentina and Spain under diverse indoor conditions. An evaluation is presented of the influence of daylighting and lighting design in museums and its relationship with other environmental conditions in the quality of exhibitions. Conclusions include recommendations for museum administrators about lighting in the exhibition of vulnerable pieces in museums. {\textcopyright} 2011 WIT Press.},

abstract = {Indoor localization has garnered the attention of researchers over the past two decades due to diverse and numerous applications. The existing works either provide room-level or latitude-longitude prediction instead of a hybrid solution, catering only to specific application needs. This paper proposes a new infrastructure-less, indoor localization system named HybLoc using Wi-Fi fingerprints. The system employs Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based soft clustering and Random Decision Forest (RDF) ensembles for hybrid indoor localization i.e., both room-level and latitude-longitude prediction. GMM-based soft clustering allows finding natural data subsets helping cascaded classifiers better learn underlying data dynamics. The RDF ensembles enhance the capabilities of decision trees providing better generalization. A publically available Wi-Fi fingerprints data set UJIIndoorLoc (multi-floor and multi-building) has been used for experimental evaluation. The results describe the potential of HybLoc to provide the hybrid location of user viz a viz the reported literature for both levels of prediction. For room estimation, HybLoc has demonstrated mean 85{\%} accuracy, 89{\%} precision as compared with frequently used k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based approaches with 56{\%} accuracy, 60{\%} precision and 42{\%} accuracy, 48{\%} precision, respectively, averaged over all buildings. We also compared HybLoc performance with baseline Random Forest providing 79{\%} accuracy and 82{\%} precision which clearly demonstrates the enhanced performance by HybLoc. In terms of latitude-longitude prediction, HybLoc, kNN, ANN, and baseline Random Forest had 6.29 m, 8.1 m, 180.7 m, and 10.2 m mean error over complete data set. We also present useful results on how number of samples and missing data replacement value affect the performance of the system. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Augmented reality allows users to visualize annotations, videos, and images overlaid on physical objects through the use of a camera. However, the high computational processing cost of matching an image seen through a camera with that in an enormous database of images makes it daunting to use the concept of augmented reality on a smartphone. As matching an image with another takes time, some researchers leverage Global Positioning System (GPS) for localizing outdoor objects. Tagging images with GPS location reduces the number of images that are required to find a match which improves the overall efficiency. Unfortunately, this approach is not suitable for indoor environment as GPS does not work in indoor environments. To address this problem, we propose a system for mobile augmented reality (MAR) in indoor environments. By leveraging the already available Wi-Fi infrastructure, we estimate the location of the users inside a building to narrow down the search space. Furthermore, we utilize the smartphone motion sensors such as accelerometers and magnetometers to detect the phone's direction towards an object, and also to capture the inclination degree of the smartphone to further reduce the search domain for an object. We deployed the system in a building at Florida State University. We tested our proposal and found that using the system we decreased the matching time significantly. Due to refining the search domain of the annotated image database, MAR uses the object recognition algorithm more efficiently and decreases the matching time from 2.8 s to just 17 ms with a total of 200 annotated images. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

However, there are many challenges and limitations associated with the structuring and querying of spatial objects in indoor spaces. The purpose of this study is to address the current trends, limitations and future challenges associated with the structuring and querying of spatial objects in indoor spaces. Also it addresses the related features of indoor spaces such as indoor structures, positioning technologies and others. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the author focuses on understanding the aspects and challenges of spatial database managements in indoor spaces. The author explains the differences between indoor spaces and outdoor spaces. Also examines the issues pertaining to indoor spaces positioning and the impact of different shapes and structures within these spaces. In addition, the author considers the varieties of spatial queries that relate specifically to indoor spaces. Findings: Most of the research on data management in indoor spaces does not consider the issues and the challenges associated with indoor positioning such as the overlapping of Wi-Fi. The future trend of the indoor spaces includes included different shapes of indoors beside the current 2D indoor spaces on which the majority of the data structures and query processing for spatial objects have focused on. The diversities of the indoor environments features such as directed floors, multi-floors cases should be considered and studied. Furthermore, indoor environments include many special queries besides the common ones queries that used in outdoor spaces such as KNN, range and temporal queries. These special queries need to be considered in data management and querying of indoor environments.

abstract = {The indexing and tracking of objects moving in indoor spaces has increasingly become an important area of research, which presents a fundamentally different challenge. There are two main reasons for why indoor should be treated as cellular space. Firstly, an indoor space has entities, such as rooms and walls, that constrain the movement of the moving objects. Secondly, the relevant notion of locations of an object is cell based rather than an exact Euclidean coordinate. As a solution, in our earlier works, we proposed a cell-based indexing structure, called the C-tree, for indexing objects moving in indoor space. In this paper, we extend the C-tree to solve another interesting problem. It can be observed that many indoor spaces (such as shopping centers) contain wings/sections. For such a space, there are queries for which the wing/section location of an object, rather than the cellular location, is the relevant answer (e.g., "the object is in the east wing"). In this paper, we propose a new index structure, called the GMI-tree ("GMI" stands for "Graph-based Multidimensional Index"). The GMI-tree is based on two notions of distance, or equivalently, two notions of adjacency: one represents horizontal adjacency and the other represents vertical adjacency. {\textcopyright} 2018 Sultan Alamri et al.},

Thus, the requirement for the tracking and monitoring of moving objects in indoor spaces has increased considerably. The indexing of moving objects in indoor spaces is of essential importance, as these are different from outdoor spaces in many respects, such as the measurements and the positioning technologies. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new adjacency-index structure for objects moving in indoor space which includes both spatial and temporal properties. The spatial index is based on the connectivity (adjacency) between the indoor environment cells. Moreover, we propose two temporal indexes with different methods to store the temporal data, which can support and enable efficient query processing and efficient updates for objects moving in indoor space. The proposed indexes can efficiently serve different types of spatial queries, such as KNN and indoor range, and a variety of temporal queries which are essential in an indoor environment.

Wireless signals are sent to readers from simple inexpensive tags to determine their locations. There are many researchers who have carried out Landmarc algorithm in different areas. In order to further enlarge the application domain and localization, Landmarc algorithm was the first attempt active RFID tag for indoor location sensing. However, this algorithm has many limitations; some of these limitations were taken into consideration in this paper, such as, improving the localization accuracy, the need for more reference tags that are considered costly and lack of a proper and efficient way to avoid the RF interference phenomenon. In addition, the calculation the Euclidian distance between the tracking tag and all reference tags in the area will select unnecessary reference tags to be nearest reference tags to tracking tags. This paper proposed a new Virtual Landmarc (VL) algorithm and Inclusive and Exclusive constant, to solve the limitation of the Landmarc. The Inclusive and Exclusive being used to estimate the position of the target by the range of the readers used. The results, shows that the accuracy of the Virtual Landmarc is 99.9{\%} with error distance e=0.626157 and the accuracy of the Landmarc is 90{\%} with error distance e=0.788345.},

Realizing this vision requires cities to make significant investments in all kinds of smart objects. Recently, the concept of smart vehicle has also emerged as a viable solution for various pressing problems such as traffic management, drivers' comfort, road safety and on-demand provisioning services. With the availability of onboard vehicular services, these vehicles will be a constructive key enabler of smart cities. Smart vehicles are capable of sharing and storing digital content, sensing and monitoring its surroundings, and mobilizing on-demand services. However, the provisioning of these services is challenging due to different ownerships, costs, demand levels, and rewards. In this paper, we present the concept of Smart Vehicle as a Service (SVaaS) to provide continuous vehicular services in smart cities. The solution relies on a location prediction mechanism to determine a vehicle's future location. Once a vehicle's predicted location is determined, a Quality of Experience (QoE) based service selection mechanism is used to select services that are needed before the vehicle's arrival. We provide simulation results to show that our approach can adequately establish vehicular services in a timely and efficient manner. It also shows that the number of utilized services have been doubled when prediction and service discovery is applied.},

Location Based IoT applications range from tracking objects and people in real-time, assets management, agriculture, assisted monitoring technologies for healthcare, and smart homes, to name a few. Radio Frequency based systems for indoor positioning such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a key enabler technology for the IoT due to its costeffective, high readability rates, automatic identification and, importantly, its energy efficiency characteristic. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art RFID technologies in IoT Smart Homes applications. It presents several comparable studies of RFID based projects in smart homes and discusses the applications, techniques, algorithms, and challenges of adopting RFID technologies in IoT smart home systems.},

abstract = {A Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based Indoor Location Method (ILS) is presented in this contribution. The motivation is the location/tracking of person/assets in indoor scenarios. The proposed network infrastructure consists on a set of receivers that measures the RSS value from a transmitter node which is attached to the asset to be located. Theoretical bases of the method are the integral equations relating the electromagnetic (EM) fields with their sources, establishing a cost function relating the measured field at the receivers and the unknown position of the transmitter. The location method is evaluated in several indoor scenarios using portable measurement equipment. Once the method is successfully tested, next step is the network hardware implementation: for this purpose, ZigBee nodes have been selected. Finally, an application example using the proposed ZigBee-based sensor network is presented.},

Similar to the case of dense urban areas where many obstacles exist, indoor localization techniques suffer from outlying measurements caused by severe multipath propagation and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. Obstructions in the signal path caused by static or mobile objects downgrade localization accuracy. We use robust multipath mitigation techniques to detect and filter out outlying measurements in indoor environments. We validate our approach using a power-based localization system with GSM. We conducted experiments without any prior knowledge of the tracked device's radio settings or the indoor radio environment. We obtained localization errors in the range of 3m even if the sensors had NLOS links to the target device.},

Micro-localization refers to the phenomena of tracking a target with high accuracy, which is an integral part of location-aware applications, both indoor and outdoor. Although many approaches towards localization have already been proposed in many research works, Received Signal Strength Identification (RSSI) based localization using the latest BLE technology is comparatively a new concept and it reduces the energy requirements of such applications. But RSSI based distance calculation provide only a rough estimation of the proximity and does not give an accurate result for micro-localization. This paper presents and evaluates a computationally simple method for micro-localization of an object from the RSSI values from a collection of iBeacons so the method can be used in devices with very low processing power. Among the different scenarios the experiments were conducted, most of them resulted in localization error of less than 1m. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Increasing tour efficiency while minimizing resources required has been studied by many researchers. The traditional multilingual human tour guides limit in the fact that, they cannot provide personalized information to every visitor because of time constraint. Also, having persons to assist tourists as a guide is expensive. Some tour guide robots and devices were presented in previous works to overcome certain limitations, but some challenges still exist. In this work, an indoor location-aware portable device is presented aiming at improving the user's experience during a tour of an indoor facility. The proposed system can provide personalized audio-visual information based on the location of the visitor, making the visitors independent of following a guide. The core of the module is a Raspberry Pi 3 with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi transceivers. Localization is performed using iBeacons, and RFID technology is used to identify certain objects. The Thingworx platform has been used as the application cloud server while YouTube has been used to present visual feedback to the user.},

This paper has two major contributions. First, we present an integrated behavior system that is able to trigger behaviors according to speech commands, by recognizing objects, triggering actions and generating whole body motions on-line. Second, we present a situated natural language instruction system that is able not only to act according to speech commands, but also response to the direction of the sound source. A system that is able to understand natural language instructions and act accordingly will need the integration of knowledge representation, perception, decision making and on-line motion generation technologies. This paper tackles this integration problem by addressing the issues of representing knowledge of objects and actions which facilitates natural language instructions for tasks in indoor human environments. We propose a taxonomy of objects in indoor human environments and a lexicon of actions in this preliminary attempt to construct a reliable and flexible natural language instruction system. We report on the implementation of the proposed system on humanoid robot HRP-2, which is able to locate auditory sources and receive natural language instructions from a user within 2 meters using a 8-channel microphone array connected to a speech recognition embedded system on-board the robot.},

The proposed methodology, given a training set of normal data only, classifies behaviour as normal or abnormal, using two different criteria of human behaviour abnormality (short-term behaviour and trajectory of a person). Within this system an one-class support vector machine decides short-term behaviour abnormality, while we propose a methodology that lets a continuous Hidden Markov Model function as an one-class classifier for trajectories. Furthermore, an approximation algorithm, referring to the Forward Backward procedure of the continuous Hidden Markov Model, is proposed to overcome numerical stability problems in the calculation of probability of emission for very long observations. It is also shown that multiple cameras through homography estimation provide more precise position of the person, leading to more robust system performance. Experiments in an indoor environment without uniform background demonstrate the good performance of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In a recent work, we approached this problem by constructing simulated Bluetooth and WLAN maps and assuming that Bluetooth measurements determine precisely the zone where the object is located.

The system uses an unsupervised neural network (Self Organising Feature Map) fully implemented on a low-cost, low-power automated home-based surveillance system, capable of monitoring activity level of elders living alone independently. The proposed system runs on an embedded platform with a specialised ceiling-mounted video sensor for intelligent activity monitoring. The system has the ability to learn resting locations, to measure overall activity levels and to detect specific events such as potential falls. First order motion information, including first order moving average smoothing, is generated from the 2D image coordinates (trajectories). A novel edge-based object detection algorithm capable of running at a reasonable speed on the embedded platform has been developed. The classification is dynamic and achieved in real-time. The dynamic classifier is achieved using a SOFM and a probabilistic model. Experimental results show less than 20{\%} classification error, showing the robustness of our approach over others in literature with minimal power consumption. The head location of the subject is also estimated by a novel approach capable of running on any resource limited platform with power constraints. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

The recent technological developments in indoor positioning technologies provide a huge volume of spatio-temporal data for studying dynamic interactions of moving objects. The results from such studies can be used for enhancing safety management strategies on sites by recognizing the mobility related workers` behaviors. For understanding workers` mobility behaviors to improve site safety, a system is proposed based on semantic trajectories and the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Firstly, the system captures raw spatio-temporal trajectories of workers using an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) and preprocess them for determining the important stay locations where the workers are spending the majority of their time. Then, these processed trajectories are transformed into semantic trajectories to establish an understanding of the meanings behind workers` mobility behaviors in terms of the building environment. Lastly, HMMs along with the Viterbi algorithm are used for categorizing different workers` mobility behaviors within the identified stay locations. The proposed system is tested using an indoor building environment and the results show that it holds a potential to identify high-risk workers` behaviors to improve site safety. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cleaning is usually the first step involved in the various processes employed to restore a work of art. It is also one of the most delicate and difficult operations undertaken to preserve a deteriorating art object. Generally, the criteria governing the cleaning of a work of art in stone or metal are concerned with a maximum respect and care for the original materials, the eventual irreversible alterations undergone through centuries (formation of patinas, changes of color, etc.) as well as the removal or isolation of parts that may, during later periods, have been added. Difficulties involved in cleaning works of art in marble and stone change according to the different materials involved, and their varying exposures to exterior elements. Particularly complicated are the problems arising from outdoor exposure where destructive elements such as air pollution, biological attacks, etc., are superimposed on natural weathering effects. Natural or artificial degradation almost always reveals itself as a bulk degradation that begins on the surface of these materials. The presence of varying extraneous substances on the surface often encourage the introduction and propagation of exceedingly harmful forms of degradation to the interior. Consequently, surface cleaning not only improves appearance, but preserves materials as well. Many bibliographical examples exist of statues and monuments in which superficial modifications. have strongly encouraged the advance of a degradation process towards the interior. The cleaning of works of art protected by an indoor location, though as important in every way, tends to be a generally easier affair. {\textcopyright} 1974 SPIE.},

We propose a new system, called Simultaneous Localisation and Configuration (SLAC), to address the problem of locating devices and users relative to those devices, and combine this problem into a single estimation problem. The SLAC algorithm, based on FastSLAM, is able to locate devices using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of devices and motion data from users. Simulations have been used to show the performance in a controlled environment and the effect of the amount of RSSI updates on the localisation error. Live tests in non-trivial environments showed that we can achieve room level accuracy and that the localisation can be performed in real time. This is all done locally, i.e. running on a user's device, with respect for privacy and without using any prior information of the environment or device locations. Although promising, more work is required to increase accuracy in larger environments and to make the algorithm more robust for environment noise caused by walls and other objects. Existing techniques, e.g. map fusing, can alleviate these problems. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Where, the objects that are attached to tags are located using the reference tags. However, RSSI information suffers from the multipath propagation and anisotropic interference. So, the localization accuracy will be affected severely. Also, the multipath-propagation increases whenever the reference-tags increase, and so does for the cost, and signal interference. This paper presents a boundary virtual reference label algorithm for improving the indoor-efficiency by inserting some virtual reference tags on the boundary with establishing a linear regression model that eliminates unwanted tag information from the estimation procedure.

abstract = {Traditional indoor location technologies such as infrared technology and ultrasonic technology are complex, expensive, or having unsatisfactory location accuracy. Radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies are very popular in many areas since their costs are very low. The tag in such technologies acts as the transmitter, and the radio signal strength indicator (RSSI) information is measured at the reader. However, RSSI information suffers strictly from the multipath circumstance and circumferential elements. Therefore, the localization accuracy of the boundary will be affected severely. In order to solve this problem, we introduce the boundary virtual reference label (BVIRE) algorithm to well utilize RFID techniques for locating the tracking object, which inserts some virtual reference tags on the boundary by establishing a linear regression model that eliminates unwanted tag information from the estimation procedure. The positioning accuracy of the boundary tags and stability have been improved significantly, at least 78{\%}, without adding extra reference tags or radio frequency interference. Also, the estimation errors of our improved BVIRE are much smaller compared to the virtual reference label, location identification based on the dynamic active RFID calibration (LANDMARC), ultrawide band, RADAR, and PinPoint algorithms. {\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BİTAK.},

abstract = {Objects in scenes are thought to be important for scene recognition. In this paper, we propose to utilize scene-specific objects represented by deep features for scene categorization. Our approach combines benefits of deep learning and Latent Support Vector Machine (LSVM) to train a set of scene-specific object models for each scene category. Specifically, we first use deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-Trained on the large-scale object-centric image database ImageNet to learn rich object features and a large number of general object concepts. Then, the pre-Trained CNNs is adopted to extract features from images in the target dataset, and initialize the learning of scene-specific object models for each scene category. After initialization, the scene-specific object models are obtained by alternating between searching over the most representative and discriminative regions of images in the target dataset and training linear SVM classifiers based on obtained region features. As a result, for each scene category a set of object models that are representative and discriminative can be acquired. We use them to perform scene categorization. In addition, to utilize global structure information of scenes, we use another CNNs pre-Trained on the large-scale scene-centric database Places to capture structure information of scene images. By combining objects and structure information for scene categorization, we show superior performances to state-of-The-Art approaches on three public datasets, i.e. MIT-indoor, UIUC-sports and SUN. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {The paper discusses various techniques that have emerged for estimation of location and tracking of stationary and mobile objects both in the open terrain as well as inside a building. For outdoor applications, Global Positioning System (GPS) has proven reliable and accurate. For urban and indoor applications various RF based ranging/positioning techniques have been investigated. Recently modifications to GPS for indoor applications have been proposed. For example, network assisted - GPS (A-GPS) provides via a cellular data link, additional ephemeris to stand alone GPS for aiding. Increase in the indoor GPS receiver sensitivity has been proposed by providing a large number of correlators. A number of other sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU), enhanced dead reckoning devices, miniature or micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) could come to aid for durations following the loss of GPS. In addition path constraints based on the indoor environment may assist in determining accurately the position. The objective of our research has been to provide a seamless, sensor fused tracking system in which data from various sensors may be processed using Kalman filters or more general particle filtering algorithms. Interest is in the applicability of these techniques to develop a military soldier wearable system for use in combat training systems for military operations in urban terrain (MOUT)},

As an example, the dispatch of luggage in airports requires to determine their OOA at checkpoints; as another example, the automatic steering of items in supply chains requires to sort and identify them while moving on a conveyor belt. This paper establishes a general framework for determining the OOA of objects that are moving along a monitored direction via radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems. Three techniques for OOA tracking are proposed and developed for objects equipped with RFID tags possessing ranging capabilities.

abstract = {Wireless sensors are constrained by a limited supply of energy when powered by batteries. They also have limited memory and limited computational power. The challenge of a network based on such constrained infrastructure is twofold; maintaining data reliability and energy efficiency. Availability of the instantaneous channel side or state information (CSI) at the transmitter can help it to set transmission parameters, such as power, data rate and encoding technique, to achieve optimum results. However in an indoor environment, when the movement of objects between a transmitter and a receiver is random, the estimated CSI may not be sufficient to obtain desired results. This paper evaluates the impact of channel fading on data reliability due to multipath transmission. Simulation results q the number of retransmissions required for an indoor fading channel and its impact on battery life. Although adaptive transmission techniques have been proposed and implemented to maximize throughput in several technologies including WIMAX, the primary focus of this paper is on research related to improve energy efficiency of sensor nodes rather than throughput. This is because sensors used for surveillance and monitoring are not designed for high data rates, but are meant to send data to the central station with a certain threshold bit error rate and acceptable latency. This paper proposes a transmission strategy to increase energy efficiency of fading radio channels for improved data reliability. It also emphasizes the need to introduce an opportunistic transmission strategy to meet these goals. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {High-quality positioning is of fundamental importance for an increasing variety of advanced driver assistance systems. GNSS-based systems are predominant outdoors but usually fail in enclosed areas where a direct line-of-sight to satellites is unavailable. For those scenarios, external infrastructure-based positioning systems are a promising alternative. However, external position detections have no identity information as they may belong to any object, i.e. they are anonymous. Moreover, the area covered by external sensors may contain gaps where objects cannot be observed leading to a correspondence problem between multiple detections and actual objects. We present a global tracking-by-identification approach as extension to existing local trackers that uses odometry sensor data of vehicles to find the corresponding subset of external detections. Thus, our approach enables the assignment of anonymous external detections to a specific vehicular endpoint and the estimation of its current position without requiring an initial location. The problem is decomposed resulting in a two step approach. The first algorithm determines possible track segment combinations which are used as track hypotheses. The track hypothesis generation algorithm considers spatio-temporal relationships between track segments, thus avoiding exponentially growing complexity inherent to data association problems. The second algorithm compares track hypotheses to the relative vehicle trajectory using pseudo-distance correlation metrics. In a detailed evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to reliably perform global tracking and identification of camera-observed vehicles in real-time, despite relatively large coverage gaps of the external sensors.},

The objective is an AR-based platform that can be used together with corresponding equipment (HMD, GPS receiver, and a portable computer) to generate a mixed view of the real world and superimposed virtual simulation objects in an outdoor environment. The characteristic that distinguishes the presented work from indoor AR applications is the capability to produce real time updated output as the user moves around while applying minimum constraints over the user's position and orientation. The ability to operate independently of environmental factors (e.g. lighting conditions and terrain variations) makes the described framework a powerful tool for outdoor AR applications. This paper presents initial results and an AR platform prototype (UM-AR-GPS-ROVER) that is able to place 3D graphical objects at any desired location in outdoor augmented space.},

abstract = {Visual perception methods are developed first mainly for human perception description and understanding. The results of these researches are now very popular for robots visual perception modeling. In this chapter is present first a brief review of the basic visual perception methods suitable for intelligent mobile robots applications. The analysis of these methods is directed to the mobile robot motion control, where the visual perception is used for objects or human body localization like: Bayesian visual perception methods for localization; log-polar visual perception; area of robot observation mapping using visual perception; landmark-based finding and localization with visual perception etc. The development of an algorithm for mobile robot visual perception is proposed based on the features of log-polar transformation to represent some of the objects and scene fragments in area of mobile robot area of observation in a more simple form for the image processing. The features and advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated with the popular for the mobile robots visual perception situation of motion control in a road or corridor with outdoor road edges, painted lane separation lines or indoor two side existing room or corridor lines. The proposed algorithm is tested with suitable simulations and the experiments with real mobile robots like Pioneer 3-DX (Mobil Robots INC), WiFiBot and Lego Robot Mindstorms NXT. The results are summarized and presented as graphics, test images and comparative tables in the conclusion. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

The localization of RFID tagged objects in their environment is becoming an important feature for the ubiquitous computing applications. In This paper we introduce a new positioning algorithm for RFID tags using two mobile RFID readers and landmarks which are passive or active tags with known location and distributed randomly. We present an analytical method for estimating the location of the unknown tag by using the multilateration with the landmarks and a probabilistic RFID map-based technique with Kalman Filtering to enhance the location estimation of the tag. This algorithm is independent from the readers coordinates, and hence it can be more practical due to its mobility and its low cost to achieve a high deployment of this emerging technology. Results obtained after conducting extensive simulations demonstrate the validity and suitability of the proposed algorithm to provide high performance level in terms of accuracy and scalability. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of indoor positioning, driven by techniques like RFID, Bluetooth, and smart phones, enables a variety of indoor location-based services (LBSs). Efficient queries based on semantic-constraint in indoor spaces play an important role in supporting and boosting LBSs. However, the existing indoor index techniques cannot support these semantic constraints-based queries. To solve this problem, this paper addresses the challenge of indexing moving objects in indoor spaces, in which both the moving objects and the indoor environments include semantic meanings. We present an indoor semantic-based model, which gives the formal description of semantics of indoor cells and moving objects. Then, a new semantic-based index is proposed for indoor environment, which can support queries under semantic constraint. In addition, we develop efficient algorithms for two new queries, which are the nearest neighbor query based on semantic constraints for static indoor cells and moving objects, respectively. The conducted experiment demonstrates that the proposed index structure is effective, robust, and efficient. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tingting Ben et al.},

abstract = {Moving object index is widely used in location-based services. Since people spend large parts of their lives in indoor spaces (e.g. hospitals, shopping malls, subway systems, etc.), effective management of indoor mobile data becomes very important. Existing indoor moving object indices focus on historical data queries, and only one type of queries is supported. In this paper, we propose a novel index, called MQII (multiple queries indoor index), which supports not only history queries and present queries, but also object queries and range queries. MQII is based on graph-based model, and can index two aspects with the object list and bucket list structure, such as the object and spatial-temporal scales. In order to improve the query performance, we present a RFID (radio frequency identification) data preprocessing method to reduce the size of the input data sets for MQII. Furthermore, effective update and query algorithms are developed. Experimental results show that compared with existing indoor moving object indices, the data preprocessing can reduce the amount of data. In addition, the index we proposed not only supports history queries and present queries, but also provides efficient object location queries, trajectory queries and range queries. This method can be used in various indoor spaces such as office buildings, hospitals and hotels. {\textcopyright}, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.},

This information is highly needed in the telecommunication field and particularly, in the emerging context of connected objects. In this area, the environment awareness enhanced by the location based adaptability is the key to success to ensure energy efficient pervasive communication. High data rate wireless communication may also benefit from the location information by using modulation in the spatial domain, in addition to modulation in frequency, time or code domain. To access the spatial domain, a microwave interferometric location system (MILS), leading to a-two dimensional (2D) location, has been developed. The combination of this phase sensitive device with a stereoscopic measurement allows a precise 3 dimensional (3D) indoor location. Tested, indoor and outdoor, at a frequency compatible with Bluetooth applications, this system point out the feasibility of such approach.},

abstract = {Working memory (WM) tasks may involve brain activation actually implicated in long-term memory (LTM). In order to disentangle these two memory systems, we employed a combined WM/LTM task, using a spatial relational (object-location) memory paradigm and analyzed which brain areas were associated with successful performance for either task using fMRI. Critically, we corrected for the performance on the respective memory task when analyzing subsequent memory effects. The WM task consisted of a delayed-match-to-sample task assessed in an MRI scanner. Each trial consisted of an indoor or outdoor scene in which the exact configuration of four objects had to be remembered. After a short delay (7–13 s), the scene was presented from a different angle and spatial recognition for two objects was tested. After scanning, participants received an unexpected subsequent recognition memory (LTM) task, where the two previously unprobed objects were tested. Brain activity during encoding, delay phase and probe phase was analyzed based on WM and LTM performance. Results showed that successful WM performance, when corrected for LTM performance, was associated with greater activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus during the early stage of the maintenance phase. A correct decision during the WM probe was accompanied by greater activation in a wide network, including bilateral hippocampus, right superior parietal gyrus and bilateral insula. No voxels exhibited supra-threshold activity during the encoding phase, and we did not find any differential activity for correct versus incorrect trials in the WM task when comparing LTM correct versus LTM incorrect trials. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract = {We consider the problem of enabling a robot to efficiently obtain a dense haptic map of its visible surroundings using the complementary properties of vision and tactile sensing. Our approach assumes that visible surfaces that look similar to one another are likely to have similar haptic properties. We present an iterative algorithm that enables a robot to infer dense haptic labels across visible surfaces when given a color-plus-depth (RGB-D) image along with a sequence of sparse haptic labels representative of what could be obtained via tactile sensing. Our method uses a color-based similarity measure and connected components on color and depth data. We evaluated our method using several publicly available RGBD image datasets with indoor cluttered scenes pertinent to robot manipulation. We analyzed the effects of algorithm parameters and environment variation, specifically the level of clutter and the type of setting, like a shelf, table top, or sink area. In these trials, the visible surface for each object consisted of an average of 8602 pixels, and we provided the algorithm with a sequence of haptically-labeled pixels up to a maximum of 40 times the number of objects in the image. On average, our algorithm correctly assigned haptic labels to 76.02{\%} of all of the object pixels in the image given this full sequence of labels. We also performed experiments with the humanoid robot DARCI reaching in a cluttered foliage environment while using our algorithm to create a haptic map. Doing so enabled the robot to reach goal locations using a single plan after a single greedy reach, while our previous tactile-only mapping method required 5 or more plans to reach each goal. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Recognizing that such environment often have a large number of instances of a small number of types of objects, we propose an alternative approach, Model-Instance Object Mapping that reasons about the models of objects distinctly from their different instances. Observations classified as short-term features by Episodic non-Markov Localization are clustered to detect object instances. For each object instance, an occupancy grid is constructed, and compared to every other object instance to build a directed similarity graph. Common object models are discovered as strongly connected components of the graph, and their models as well as distribution of instances saved as the final Model-Instance Object Map. By keeping track of the poses of observed instances of object models, Model-Instance Object Maps learn the most probable locations for commonly observed object models. We present results of Model-Instance Object Mapping over the course of a month in our indoor office environment, and highlight the common object models thus learnt in an unsupervised manner. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The proposed method performs the event filtering to selects the necessary reference tags and then computes the accurate locations of objects. If the locations of objects are changed then update the locations of objects. To show the superiority of our proposed method, we compare it with LANDMARC, which is the most popular localization method. It shows that the proposed system reduces the computation cost of location estimation 500 times more than LANDMARC. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In today's world, the rapid advancement of technology allows us to find new solutions to old problems in critical areas, namely patient and staff tracking in healthcare facilities. The medical staff within these facilities are in an environment where they depend on immediately knowing the location of a patient or other medical staff. McAllister et al. [1] proposed a solution named LoCATE (Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment) which uses existing technology to track all patients and medical staff in near real time. LoCATE makes use of the current wireless networks (e.g., WiFi) within a healthcare facility by using edge node technology as its tracking solution. It can locate an object within three to five feet of its calculated position. The ubiquity of WiFi infrastructure in healthcare facilities makes it an attractive option to use, as the backbone for a patient and staff tracking system. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge nodes create security holes in networks and leak data to the open world. This paper aims to analyze what security holes and data leaks LoCATE creates in a healthcare facility. In this paper, we show the dangers of using simple and default passwords, the need to physically secure edge nodes, and the importance of securing data before transmission. We exploit the system's weak security measures by forging edge node data, gaining unauthorized access, performing denial of service attack, and launching other attacks. We analyze the successfulness of these attacks to offer mitigation techniques for future devices located in other critical areas similar to the healthcare facilities. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

Research assessments are conducted to evaluate technologies integrated on a robotic platform. In this study, a Clearpath Husky is equipped with a robotic arm, monocular and stereo camera pair, and a Hokuyo scanning laser rangefinder. The purpose of this investigation, drawing upon intelligence, perception, and dexterous manipulation, is to assess the ability of the system to autonomously search a room for an object, identify the object, and position the robot so the object can be grabbed and lifted by the arm/end effector. The system capability requires integration of several component capabilities related to room mapping, semantic labeling, precise movement, robot and arm planning, and obstacle detection and avoidance. The Husky used previously developed mapping algorithms to map the room until it identified the search object, at which time its focus was directed to positioning for the grasp-object task and executing the grasp via the robot arm/end effector. Two indoor areas at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania were used for the experiment. Experimental conditions varied the orientation of a single target object, the location of the object, and the presence of obstacles acting to obscure the object during the search and challenged the planning to enable the arm to make the grasp.},

abstract = {The development of mobile robots for domestic assistance requires solving problems integrating ideas from different fields of research like computer vision, robotic manipulation, localization and mapping. Semantic mapping, that is, the enrichment a map with highlevel information like room and object identities, is an example of such a complex robotic task. Solving this task requires taking into account hard software and hardware constraints brought by the context of autonomous mobile robots, where short processing times and low energy consumption are mandatory. We present a light-weight scene segmentation and object instance recognition algorithm using an RGB-D camera and demonstrate it in a semantic mapping experiment. Our method uses a feed-forward neural network to fuse texture, color and depth information. Running at 3Hz on a single laptop computer, our algorithm achieves a recognition rate of 97{\%} in a controlled environment, and 87{\%} in the adversarial conditions of a real robotic task. Our results demonstrate that state of the art recognition rates on a database does not guarantee performance in a real world experiment. We also show the benefit in these conditions of fusing several recognition decisions and data from different sources. The database we compiled for the purpose of this study is publicly available. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an implementation of indoor localization, where the location of an object is determined without using the outdoor infrastructure of GPS. Various work involving different technologies exist, but the field remains open to a solution which can attain widespread use, in consideration of cost and infrastructure needed for deployment. For our implementation, we localized a common smartphone in an area with many WiFi signals. The main method was through RSS fingerprinting which was able to achieve a mean error of 2.5 m, aside from outliers that drove the error to 16 m. To improve this, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) techniques were leveraged in addition to the WiFi system. Realtime testing showed that the WiFi+PDR system was able to achieve a 2.28 m mean localization error, while it reached 2.62 m for the WiFi-only approach. Finally, a peer-to-peer approach was explored, in which neighboring smartphone peers were treated as pseudo access points to help eliminate the outlier errors that resulted from very similar RSS fingerprints. To measure distance between peers, an acoustic method was employed using 1 KHz sine waves. The Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) was computed between peers, and the readings allowed for coarse estimates in 5-m bins. However, for very noisy environments, this frequency range may cause the acoustic system to be erroneous, possibly driving the error to as high as 18.01 m. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm to track mobile objects in different scene conditions. The main idea of the proposed tracker includes estimation, multi-features similarity measures and trajectory filtering. A feature set (distance, area, shape ratio, color histogram) is defined for each tracked object to search for the best matching object. Its best matching object and its state estimated by the Kalman filter are combined to update position and size of the tracked object. However, the mobile object trajectories are usually fragmented because of occlusions and misdetections. Therefore, we also propose a trajectory filtering, named global tracker, aims at removing the noisy trajectories and fusing the fragmented trajectories belonging to a same mobile object. The method has been tested with five videos of different scene conditions. Three of them are provided by the ETISEO benchmarking project (http://www-sop.inria.fr/orion/ETISEO) in which the proposed tracker performance has been compared with other seven tracking algorithms. The advantages of our approach over the existing state of the art ones are: (i) no prior knowledge information is required (e.g. no calibration and no contextual models are needed), (ii) the tracker is more reliable by combining multiple feature similarities, (iii) the tracker can perform in different scene conditions: single/several mobile objects, weak/strong illumination, indoor/outdoor scenes, (iv) a trajectory filtering is defined and applied to improve the tracker performance, (v) the tracker performance outperforms many algorithms of the state of the art.},

Another important advantage of this method is that it allows the mobile device to determine its location while remaining anonymous, unidentified to the beacons or other nearby devices. In such a deployment, an important design task is the placement of beacons. Signal propagation in indoor environments is complex, affected by factors such as floor-plans and duct-work, varying transmission and reflection properties of building materials and furniture, and interference from other devices. Therefore, the area from which a beacon is visible is very irregular and not well approximated by simple models such as ellipsoids.

Only feature points with large scales are considered as worth-tracking features to reduce the computation load and enhance the robustness. These feature information are input to an extended Kalman filter with the spatial coordinates of the feature points and that of the observing camera as its state variables. The angular and translational velocity and acceleration of the camera are also included as the state variables. Compared to previous approaches, we use the reciprocal of the depth, instead of the depth itself, as the state variable, together with other state variables, in the extended Kalman filter to represent the relative distance between the camera and the feature points. The extended Kalman filter can accurately estimate the spatial location of the feature points and that of the camera with only one camera after a very short period for those feature points experiencing significant change in parallax. We have tested the proposed method with a hand-held camera walking in both indoor and outdoor environment. The outdoor environment for the experiment is populated with both close and distant objects.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel object tracking method based on SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) feature matching. First an object SIFT feature database is built offline. Then we detect and locate the object online by exactly matching SIFT feature between test image and the database using a K-tree based nearest neighbor algorithm. According to the location, an active camera is controlled to make the object always lie in the center of view. The validity is proved by the experiments accomplished in real indoor environment. The true positive of our method is up to 94{\%}, while that of HSV based method is less than 80{\%} in our experimental conditions. Experimental results shows that the method is offictive.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel indoor positioning technique based on neural network. Each sensor was modeled by an independent neural network in order to catch the mapping between the object's position coordinate and the received signal strengths from different directions and distances. Unlike the traditional neural network application in this field, the position coordinate of the object was used as the input and the received signal strength was used as the output in the neural model. We assume that if the distance between sensor and object is fixed, then the sensed signal strengths from different directions should be the same. A new least-squares location estimation method was developed to calculate the object's position in accordance with the received signal strengths sensed by different sensors and the estimated coordinates given by all neural networks. From the simulation results shown, it is clearly found that the new indoor position technique developed is more accurate and more stable than the traditional neural network approaches. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Guiding navigation is an important application in wireless sensor networks to make moving objects leave dangerous areas safely and quickly. However, guiding policy without considering congestion problem will postpone the escape time. In this paper, we propose a distributed flow-based guiding protocol for indoor environments to evacuate mobile objects from dangerous area to exit. Our goal is to construct less congested paths to minimize the escape time and the congestion time. Each sensor in the network holds an artificial potential value determined by the moving speed of object on a path monitored by it, the distances to exits, and the capacity of exits that have the maximum potential values, and objects are directed to paths with higher potential values. Nevertheless, our approach also solves the local maximum problem that objects are trapped at a non-exit location holding a local maximum potential value. In addition, we adopt a traffic flow model for transforming object density of a road into object's velocity to reduce the computational cost and the communication overhead. Simulation results show our proposed protocol can efficiently decrease the escape time and congestion time. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Navigation applications and location-based services are now becoming standard features in smart phones. However, locating a mobile user anytime anywhere is still a challenging task, especially in GNSS degraded and denied environments such as urban canyons and indoor environments. To approach a seamless indoor/outdoor positioning solution, self-contained sensors, such as accelerometers, digital compasses, gyros, and pressure sensors are being adapted as augmentation technologies to a GNSS receiver. However, the GNSS obstructed areas are typically contaminated such that significant error sources disturb the measurements of the augmenting sensors as well, e.g. a digital compass can be disturbed significantly by any object bearing magnetic perturbance, for example, an elevator; not to mention the problems of signal-degraded areas e.g. indoors. This paper presents a DSP-based positioning platform based on multiple sensors and multiple networks. The positioning sensors include a GNSS receiver and low-cost self-contained sensors (accelerometer and digital compass), while the networks include WLAN/Bluetooth. Algorithms applying GNSS, sensor measurements, and network measurements for data validation, outlier rejection, and positioning are discussed in this paper. Test results in both indoor and outdoor environments are presented and the positioning performance is demonstrated.},

In our approach, a cost function associated with a shape constraint factor is used to find the optimal reference tag positions that enclose the tracking tag. The cost function consists of the similarity and disparity of signal strength between the tracking and reference tags, as well as geometrical correlation properties. The experimental results indicate that the proposed shape constraint algorithm provides considerable improvement in average estimation error as compared with existing methods.

abstract = {We present a 3D positioning system called Pokeball, which uses a single-source magnetic sphere. The system comprises three mutually orthogonal coils and an Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) to generate the designated signals. By applying Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), Pokeball generates two rotating magnetic fields with different frequencies of phase-quadrature current signals. The positioning object is equipped with a three-axis magnetoresistive sensor that measures the strength of the magnetic field and extracts the results into two signals with different frequencies. The phases of the two signals are used to determine the elevation and azimuth angles, while the amplitudes of the signals are used to calculate the distance between the source and the object. Then, based on the calculations, the location of the object is determined. The results of a comprehensive set of experiments demonstrate that Pokeball can achieve an accuracy of less than 40 cm for positioning errors in its effective positioning range. Moreover, Pokeball does not require site surveys, and it is robust against radio interference and environmental obstructions. Our approach has a great deal of potential for use in a wide range of applications, such as mobile systems, wearable computing devices, and location-based applications, where an instantaneous and accurate indoor 3D positioning system is essential. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

The goal is to locate video sequences containing events of interest to the user. This framework starts by tracking objects and segmenting videos into Common Appearance Intervals (CAIs). The spatiotemporal trajectories are obtained, based on which features are extracted for the construction of semantic event models. In the retrieval, the database user interacts with the machine and provides "feedbacks" to the retrieval result. The learning component learns from the spatiotemporal data, the semantic event model as well as the "feedback" and returns the refined result to the user. Specifically, the learning algorithm is developed based on a Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM), which models the interactions of objects in CAIs and recognizes hidden patterns among them. This iterative learning and retrieval process contributes to the bridging of the "semantic gap", and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Using quadrotor as an indoor robot asks for accurate locating and control methods. To solve this problem, a composite algorithm combining MIMU(Micro Inertial Measurement Unit) and monocular vision is used. The algorithm uses the measurement of MIMU as the source of position updating, while monocular vision algorithm provides the detection result of the feature of reference lines on the ground. The location of the reference lines detected is then compared with the result of MIMU, and the combination of these two results brings more accurate locating result for quadrotor. Compared to using MIMU, the error can decrease from ±50cm to ±10cm when the height of quadrotor is 1m. An object following platform is used for validating the composite algorithm, and system identification method is used for modeling the AR.Drone. Trajectory following algorithm and object following method are also developed.

The AR technique can be used to develop Pedestrian Navigation Systems (PNSs), but high-precision positioning is needed for displaying AR objects at proper places. However, the required level of accuracy is far beyond current commercial positioning solutions, e.g., outdoor GPS and indoor RF systems. In this paper, we propose an AR-based positioning technique for AR users to position their locations. First, by utilizing a coarse positioning system, AR objects can be roughly displayed on the touch screen of a AR device. Then, AR objects can be matched with their images on the display via drag-and-drop operations by users. Thus, both the coordinates of the AR objects in the image and in the real world can be known. Based on the coordinates along with the knowledge of the camera focal length, the location at which the photograph was taken can be known. The location of the camera can be treated as the location of the user. The proposed positioning technique is very helpful in developing high-precision PNSs. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an algorithm for precise estimation of moving objects density (typically people and vehicles) in indoor and outdoor scenes. Automatic generation of the so-called density maps is based on video sequences acquired by surveillance systems. Our approach offers two types of solutions. The first one increments the accumulation table when a moving object is detected in a location of interest, delivering a density map of the presence of moving objects. The second algorithm increments the accumulation table only in cases of detecting a new moving object, resulting in a density map of the count of moving objects. The proposed algorithms were tested with the use of PETS 2009 database and with our own database of long-term video recordings. Finally, results of the density maps visualization and determination of the "busy hours" are presented. {\textcopyright} 2015 Agata Chmielewska et al.},

This paper presents a robust audio identification method for enhancing a real-time indoor localization system on a mobile device using the audio signals emitted by nearby loudspeakers. The proposed audio identification method deals with various noise distortions due to different noisy indoor locations by using foreground/background audio separation, prominent spectral pitch-based binary audio fingerprinting, and spectral peak-triplet-based audio fingerprinting. Experimental results confirm that the proposed audio identification method is quite robust in different noise conditions and achieves preliminary promising results for discriminating the location and orientation of a user in large indoor locations. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recently, interests in 3D indoor modeling and positioning have been growing. Data fusion by using different sensors data is one of the 3D model producing methods. For a data fusion between two kinds of sensors, precise system calibration is essential. If relative geometric location of each sensor can be accurately measured with a system-calibration, it is possible to locate a pixel that corresponds to the same object in two different images, and thus, produce a more precise data-fusion. Purpose of this study is finding more efficient method of system calibration between optical and range sensor. For this urpose, experiment was designed by considering following variables, i) system calibration method, ii) testbed type, iii) and distance data(whether use it or not). So, In this study, test-bed for system calibration was designed by considering the characteristics of sensors. Also, precise simulation was done to find efficient method of system calibration, and its results were reflected in real experiment. Results of simulation show that the bundle adjustment method is more efficient than single photo resection in system calibration between range and optical sensors. And the most efficient case was when using i) the bundle adjustment with ii) the simulated data set which were obtained between 2m to 4m away from the test-bed. These results of simulation were reflected in real system calibration. Finally, real system calibration were performed and its results were compared to results of simulation. And accuracy of system calibration was evaluated by producing fusion data between range and optical sensors.},

The received signal strength (RSS) from various reference points (RP) were recorded by a tool and fingerprint radio map is constructed. The signal property of a fingerprint will differ in each point. The location can be found by comparing the current signal strength with already collected radio maps. Almost all indoor environments are equipped with Wi-Fi devices. No additional hardware is required for the setup. In this paper, we introduce SVM classifier (Roos et al. in IEEE Trans Mob Comput 1(1), 59–69, 2002 [2]) as a methodology with minimum cost and without scarifying accuracy.

The target to be tracked carries listener node, this node listens the beacons information as they arrived and forwards these beacons to the base station .At the base station the multilateration was used to determine the location of the listener. This information at the base station was further processed to check the activity of the person. In the location-tracking system we also could calculate the user's activity, that is, how much the user moves in span of time.

Even many papers deals with this subject, and some solutions were tested, currently we have no mature commercial implementations. Based on WLAN, RFID, WSN, ZigBee or proprietary solutions, location systems working principles implies the measurement of radio signals. Due to propagation issues in real working conditions, the practical demonstrated performances are far enough from theoretical simulation results. In indoor environments, the presence of different objects in rooms may cause multiple propagation paths, dynamic position changing objects or human presence affect the measurement precision. In this paper, we evaluate a 2.4 GHz WSN based location system both in an isolated environment setup - in a shielded room, and in real conditions in a laboratory room and compare the results. We measure the electromagnetic field generated by the system, in order to estimate the potential risks to humans if these systems are massively deployed.},

abstract = {Indoor position tracking systems are essential to support new types of applications for domotics and elderly care services. Unfortunately, while locating moving objects (e.g., people in a room) typically requires accuracy in the order of a few tens of cm, the intrinsically crowded nature of indoor environments (e.g., due to the presence of obstacles and/or multiple targets) as well as manifold sources of uncertainty may considerably degrade measurement results. In this paper, we present a local positioning system (LPS) provided with wireless connectivity. The proposed solution relies on two cascaded extended Kalman filters. The first one estimates the attitude of the platform within a global reference frame. The second one relies on the estimated attitude to return the planar position of the moving object in a room. The proposed approach is much more scalable than centralized location tracking techniques (e.g. based on external cameras only) because it does not require collecting and processing large data sets in real-time. Also, just low-rate position corrections are needed to keep uncertainty within given boundaries. Such position calibration values, measured with any type of external positioning infrastructure, can be sent to the LPS through a low-cost radio link like in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), at no risk of saturating the communication channel even when multiple objects are present in the room.},

Its hardware architecture is composed of a Head Mounted Display, a wide Field of View (FOV) stereo-vision passive system, a gaze tracker and a laptop. An associated software architecture is proposed to immerse the user in augmented environments where he/she can move freely. The system maps the unknown real-world (indoor or outdoor) environment and is localized into this map by means of binocular state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping techniques. It overcomes the FOV limitations of conventional augmented reality devices by using wide-angle cameras and associated algorithms. It also solves the parallax issue induced by the distinct locations of the two cameras and of the user's eyes by using Depth Image Based Rendering. An embedded gaze tracker, together with environment modeling techniques, enable gaze controlled interaction. A simple application is presented, in which a virtual object is inserted into the user's FOV and follows his/her gaze.

abstract = {In this demonstration paper, we present a powerful distributed framework for finding similar trajectories in a smartphone network, without disclosing the traces of participating users. Our framework, exploits opportunistic and participatory sensing in order to quickly answer queries of the form: “Report objects (i.e., trajectories) that follow a similar spatio-temporal motion to Q, where Q is some query trajectory.” SmartTrace, relies on an in-situ data storage model, where geo-location data is recorded locally on smartphones for both performance and privacy reasons. SmartTrace then deploys an efficient top-K query processing algorithm that exploits distributed trajectory similarity measures, resilient to spatial and temporal noise, in order to derive the most relevant answers to Q quickly and efficiently. Our demonstration shows how the SmartTrace algorithmics are ported on a network of Android-based smartphone devices with impressive query response times. To demonstrate the capabilities of SmartTrace during the conference, we will allow the attendees to query local smartphone networks in the following two modes: (i) Interactive Mode, where devices will be handed out to participants aiming to identify who is moving similar to the querying node; and (ii) Trace-driven Mode, where a large-scale deployment can be launched in order to show how the K most similar trajectories can be identified quickly and efficiently. The conference attendees will be able to appreciate how interesting spatio-temporal search applications can be implemented efficiently (for performance reasons) and without disclosing the complete user traces to the query processor (for privacy reasons)1. For instance, an attendee might be able to determine other attendees that have participated in common sessions, in order to initiate new discussions and collaborations, without knowing their trajectory or revealing his/her own trajectory either.},

Also, the RFID localization system is constrained by its limited accuracy. In this study, we propose an indoor localization and monitoring system based on a network of PIR sensors and RFID sensors - a sensory fusion system. A sensor-network based localization method called the PIR-RFID inference algorithm is under development. This algorithm determines the fused position from both the PIR localization system and RFID signal localization system, which utilize the received signal strength propagation model. We have developed and experimentally demonstrated a networked sensory fusion system, which can be successfully applied in localize multiple targets - equipment and people. With an accurate localization mechanism for the indoor environment, the provision of appropriate tasks / services can be built for each modeled situation. What is new in this system, as an evolved sensory fusion system, is that the entire system has been designed and built according with specific requests of a real life situation, as standalone system, on its own, that is, regardless of the other systems a production area / shop floor / equipment a building can have. This system can interact with practically any systems at any level and can be adapted to virtually any existing building system. {\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE.},

The current system is capable of estimating the position of an object using the signal strength received by a mobile device in a ZigBee sensor network. Received strength signal indication measurements were done in laboratory for applying a estimation method. Two models were utilized (a) log-distance path loss - model in which signal lost has a random influence with log-normal distribution, and (b) free space decay law - based on the decay law for a signal on a open space.

Unfortunately, in the context of RGB-D scene understanding, very little data is available - current datasets cover a small range of scene views and have limited semantic annotations. To address this issue, we introduce ScanNet, an RGB-D video dataset containing 2.5M views in 1513 scenes annotated with 3D camera poses, surface reconstructions, and semantic segmentations. To collect this data, we designed an easy-to-use and scalable RGB-D capture system that includes automated surface reconstruction and crowd-sourced semantic annotation.

Previous research on robotic landmine detection mostly employs a single robot equipped with a landmine detection sensor to detect landmines. We envisage that the quality of landmine detection can be significantly improved if multiple robots are coordinated to detect landmines in a cooperative manner by incrementally fusing the landmine-related sensor information they collect and then use that information to visit locations of potential landmines. Towards this objective, we describe a multirobot system called COMRADES to address different aspects of the autonomous landmine detection problem including distributed area coverage to detect and locate landmines, information aggregation to fuse the sensor information obtained by different robots, and multirobot task allocation (MRTA) to enable different robots to determine a suitable sequence to visit locations of potential landmines while reducing the time required and battery expended. We have used commercially available all-terrain robots called Coroware Explorer that are customized with a metal detector to detect metallic objects including landmines, as well as indoor Corobot robots, both in simulation and in physical experiments, to test the different techniques in COMRADES. {\textcopyright} 2015 Prithviraj Dasgupta et al.},

abstract = {Biodeterioration is a topic of ever-growing concern and is particularly relevant in the context of cultural heritage conservation, since artworks and monuments provide diversified ecological niches for microorganism colonization. Despite all the gathered knowledge in recent years, current established norms and accepted contamination thresholds have a prominent focus on human health and air quality preservation. Nonetheless they still are not enough or are not adequately applied for cultural heritage preservation. In the light of this study within a very important Museum from Coimbra (Portugal), the current knowledge and accepted norms are discussed. Despite the meticulous control of environmental parameters inside this art repository, the presence of fungal colonies was unexpectedly detected on wooden sculptures and paintings that were deposited inside a custom-built room. Contaminated art objects were sampled for fungal isolation and identification, along with seasonal indoor air sampling, for a one-year period. Molecular biology methods complemented with morphological observation were used for the identification of fungal organisms. Direct sampling of 8 contaminated paintings allowed the retrieval of 10 fungal isolates (3 different genera and 4 different species). In addition, 19 fungal isolates (5 different genera and 9 different species) were retrieved from 7 contaminated wooden sculptures. The air sampling process provided a total of 150 isolates (24 different genera and 43 different species), from which the most common genera were Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium, and the most frequent species were Aspergillus versicolor, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium copticola and P. corylophilum. Although the number of airborne CFU was considerably low in all seasons, some fungal species with known biodeterioration capability and adverse human health effects were found. The relevance of air contamination monitoring as a single tool for biodeterioration risk assessment is discussed, as are the currently available norms and recommendations. Preventive measures are advised and considerations are made regarding potentially more effective approaches. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract = {Sentient Computing provides computers with perception so that they can react and provide assistance to user activities. Physical spaces are made sentient when they are wired with networks of sensors capturing context data, which is communicated to computing devices spread through the environment. These devices interpret the information provided and react by performing the actions expected by the user. Among the types of context information provided by sensors, location has proven to be especially useful. Since location is an important context that changes whenever the user moves, a reliable location-tracking system is critical to many sentient applications. However, the sensor technologies used in indoor location tracking are expensive and complex to deploy, configure and maintain. These factors have prevented a wider adoption of Sentient Computing in our living and working spaces. This paper presents TRIP, a low-cost and easily deployable vision-based sensor technology addressing these issues. TRIP employs off-the-shelf hardware (lowcost CCD cameras and PCs) and printable 2-D circular markers for entity identification and location. The usability of TRIP is illustrated through the implementation of several sentient applications. {\textcopyright} 2002 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.},

In these environments, GPS does not work properly, causing inaccurate positioning. Currently, when performing the location of people or objects in indoor environments, no single technology can reproduce the same results achieved by the GPS for outdoor environments. One of the main reasons for this is the high complexity of indoor environments where, unlike outdoor spaces, there is a series of obstacles such as walls, equipment and even people. Due to this, it is necessary to consider the use of information from multiple sources using different technologies. Thus, this work proposes an adaptable approach for indoor location, which allows the use and combination of different technologies, techniques and methods in this context.},

For example, beds are shorter than they are wide, and are more likely to be in the center of the room than cabinets, which are tall and narrow. We use a generative statistical model that integrates a camera model, an enclosing room box, frames (windows, doors, pictures), and objects (beds, tables, couches, cabinets), each with their own prior on size, relative dimensions, and locations. We fit the parameters of this complex, multi-dimensional statistical model using an MCMC sampling approach that combines discrete changes (e.g, adding a bed), and continuous parameter changes (e.g., making the bed larger). We find that introducing object category leads to state-of-the-art performance on room layout estimation, while also enabling recognition based only on geometry. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. This includes both the ability of globally localizing the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robot's position once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as providing a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient solutions in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require modification of the environment to function properly, and those that work within unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of global localization. In this paper we present a novel, vision-based localization method based on the CONDENSATION algorithm, a Bayesian filtering method that uses a sampling-based density representation. We show how the CONDENSATION algorithm can be used in a novel way to track the position of the camera platform rather than tracking an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to globally localize the camera platform, given a visual map of the environment. Based on these two observations, we present a vision-based robot localization method that provides a solution to a difficult and open problem in the mobile robotics community. As evidence for the viability of our approach, we show both global localization and tracking results in the context of a state of the art robotics application.},

This article presents an indoor localization system in order to make a relative positioning among entities, fixed or mobile, without use an external infrastructure and only using acoustic transducers for their use in ubiquitous computing applications. Also, an analysis of the positioning algorithm, based on multidimensional scaling technique (MDS), is carried out in order to verify the errors in the position estimation when there are errors in the mechanism of ranging distances.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of amodal perception of 3D object detection. The task is to not only find object localizations in the 3D world, but also estimate their physical sizes and poses, even if only parts of them are visible in the RGB-D image. Recent approaches have attempted to harness point cloud from depth channel to exploit 3D features directly in the 3D space and demonstrated the superiority over traditional 2.5D representation approaches. We revisit the amodal 3D detection problem by sticking to the 2.5D representation framework, and directly relate 2.5D visual appearance to 3D objects. We propose a novel 3D object detection system that simultaneously predicts objects' 3D locations, physical sizes, and orientations in indoor scenes. Experiments on the NYUV2 dataset show our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and indicates 2.5D representation is capable of encoding features for 3D amodal object detection.

abstract = {The Java Community Process (JCP) has recently finalized a Java Specification Request (JSR) to cope with location-awareness (JSR-179) in Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC). Implementations of this specification may rely on several location methods, including satellite based methods like GPS, as well as short-range positioning methods based on Received Signal Strength (RSS). Though RSS is a good location fingerprint for indoor positioning, no standard technique to tailor RSS-based approaches to the JSR-179 API has been proposed yet. In this paper we propose such a technique, and we evaluate its effectiveness through a Bluetooth-based prototype. Specifically, we show how to extend the Java APIs for Bluetooth (JSR-82) in order to provide the Location API with RSS-based position-information. Moreover, we show how to adapt RSS-based approaches to Location-API's semantics. Our solution is based on the insertion of a specific component into the JSR-82 API. This is in charge of producing all the information needed to build Location objects as defined in the JSR-179. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach by examining preliminary experimental results obtained from the first system prototype. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {As we realize that we spend most of our time in increasingly complex indoor environments, applications to assist indoor activities (e.g. guidance) have gained a lot of attention in the recent years. The advances in ubiquitous computing made possible the development of several spatial models intending to support context- aware and fine-grained indoor navigation systems. However, the available models often rely on simplified representations (e.g. 2D plans) and ignore the indoor features (e.g. furniture), thereby missing to reflect the complexity of the indoor environment. In this paper, we introduce the Flexible Space Subdivision framework (FSS) that allows to automatically identify the spaces that can be used for indoor navigation purpose. We propose a classification of indoor objects based on their ability to autonomously change location and we define a spatial subdivision of the indoor environment based on the classified objects and their functions. The framework can consider any 3D indoor configuration, the static and dynamic activities it hosts and it enables the possibility to consider all types of locomotion (e.g. walking, flying, etc.). It relies on input 3D models with geometric, semantic and topological information and identifies a set of subspaces with dedicated properties. We assess the framework against criteria defined in previous researches and we provide an example. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Context awareness will become increasingly important in future domestic consumer electronics. In many domestic context aware applications, there is a need for location and orientation information about persons, devices or objects in the home. This information can be provided by a dedicated indoor location system. A consumer location system should be robust, safe, easy to set up, low cost, and should have a minimal infrastructure. In this paper, a step towards consumer location systems is taken by proposing an ultrasonic positioning method that needs just a single compact base station to measure 3D positions of mobile devices in a room. The method employs ultrasound time-of-flight tri-lateration to estimate device positions, using a base station containing an array of three ultrasound transducers. Five potential problems of the proposed method are identified; the main problem being line-of-sight path occlusion. The method has been prototyped, and initial results show an accuracy of 1.41 m or better for 95{\%} of the position estimates, in case of a good line-of-sight path. It is concluded that the method is promising for providing 3D position information at around 1 m accuracy for context aware applications, but that the problem of line-of-sight occlusion requires further investigation.},

We utilize a set of different communication technologies (WiFi, Bluetooth and radio-frequency identification) to help users reach an object with high accuracy. As a proof of concept, we deploy a fully functional testbed and we evaluate our entire solution inside our university library by helping blind users find a specific book.

Among the recorded construction fatalities in 2012, vehicle incidents accounted for 15{\%} and being hit by moving objects accounted for 10{\%}. Tracking of individuals on-site could provide a technological solution to improve safety. This paper proposes a novel, non-tagging-based, wireless networking solution (called device-free localization) to enhance safety on site. Device free localization techniques use radio signal propagation effects such as multi-path fading and shadowing caused by the obstruction(s). The proposed solution defines zones in the construction site. Zone identification is based on the risk associated with the location map of the site. Defining risk profiles considers the activities associated with the geographic location, such as loading/unloading areas, truck, and vehicle entering area. The presence of workers entering a particular zone is detected based on this device-free detection technique, which will later be extended to localization. This paper proposes a framework for defining risk-associated zones for the construction sites for the effective implementation of device-free detection systems. Feasibility of the proposed device-free detection technique is verified by preliminary experiments done in an indoor environment with high multi-path fading. {\textcopyright} ASCE 2014.},

abstract = {Highly accurate indoor localization based on significantly low complex infrastructure has recently gained great interest for a variety of innovative location-based applications. In this regards, the chipless radio frequency identification (RFID) system is presented to be the low-cost solution, while time-based ranging using the ultrawide-band spectrum is promising to offer precise ranging capability. However, the current wide-band systems suffer from the spectrum and power limitations, which restrict the function of chipless RFID-based localization systems. Therefore, we propose terahertz (THz)-based chipless RFID localization system that enables a smart object localizing itself using the infrastructure composed from reference chipless tags. In more details, THz band offers huge bandwidth providing superior-resolution localization and large coding capacity. Moreover, we utilize the combination between dielectric resonator (DR) and lens to be designed as a frequency-coded chipless tag, where this combination increases the radar cross section of the chipless tags and, hence, extends their coverage zone. This cost-efficient design of the tag enables the dense deployment of low-cost infrastructure acting as reference anchors. Furthermore, we investigate the link budget of the proposed system in order to characterize the tag and distance-dependent spectral windows that are feasible for RFID-based localization. Afterward, the time-domain backscattered signal from a DR-Lens tag is analyzed in order to perform ranging and to calculate the relative distances between the DR-Lens tags and the reader leading to determining the reader position. Measurements are performed to prove the concept of the DR-Lens tag, while the numerical simulation is conducted to evaluate the proposed localization system. Simulation results show that the proposed system can reach superior accuracy of millimeter-levels. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {There exist several tools and methods for camera resectioning, i.e. geometric calibration for the purpose of estimating intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The intrinsic parameters represent the internal properties of the camera such as focal length, principal point and distortion coefficients. The extrinsic parameters relate the cameras position to the world, i.e. how is the camera positioned and oriented in the world. With both sets of parameters known it is possible to relate a pixel in one camera to the world or to another camera. This is important in many applications, for example in stereo vision. The existing methods work well for standard visual cameras in most situations. Intrinsic parameters are usually estimated by imaging a well-defined pattern from different angles and distances. Checkerboard patterns are very often used for calibration since it is a well-defined pattern with easily detectable features. The intersections between the black and white squares form high contrast points which can be estimated with sub pixel accuracy. Knowing the precise dimension and structure of the pattern makes enables calculation of the intrinsic parameters. Extrinsic calibration can be performed in a similar manner if the exact position and orientation of the pattern is known. A common method is to distribute markers in the scene and to measure their exact locations. The key to good calibration is well-defined points and accurate measurements. Thermal cameras are a subset of infrared cameras that work with long wavelengths, usually between 9 and 14 microns. At these wavelengths all objects above absolute zero temperature emit radiation making it ideal for passive imaging in complete darkness and widely used in military applications. The issue that arises when trying to perform a geometric calibration of a thermal camera is that the checkerboard emits more or less the same amount of radiation in the black squares as in the white. In other words, the calibration board that is optimal for calibration of visual cameras might be completely useless for thermal cameras. A calibration board for thermal cameras should ideally be a checkerboard with high contrast in thermal wavelengths. (It is of course possible to use other sorts of objects or patterns but since most tools and software expect a checkerboard pattern this is by far the most straightforward solution.) Depending on the application it should also be more or less portable and work booth in indoor and outdoor scenarios. In this paper we present several years of experience with calibration of thermal cameras in various scenarios. Checkerboards with high contrast both for indoor and outdoor scenarios are presented as well as different markers suitable for extrinsic calibration. {\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

abstract = {As video databases become increasingly important for full exploitation of multimedia resources, this paper aims at describing our recent efforts in feasibility studies towards building up a content-based and high-level video retrieval/management system. The study is focused on constructing a semantic tree structure via combination of low-level image processing techniques and high-level interpretation of visual content. Specifically, two separate algorithms were developed to organise input videos in terms of two layers: the shot layer and the key-frame layer. While the shot layer is derived by developing a multi-featured shot cut detection, the key frame layer is extracted automatically by a genetic algorithm. This paves the way for applying pattern recognition techniques to analyse those key frames and thus extract high level information to interpret the visual content or objects. Correspondingly, content-based video retrieval can be conducted in three stages. The first stage is to browse the digital video via the semantic tree at structural level, the second stage is match the key frame in terms of low-level features, such as colour, shape of objects, and texture etc. Finally, the third stage is to match the high-level information, such as conversation with indoor background, moving vehicles along a seaside road etc. Extensive experiments are reported in this paper for shot cut detection and key frame extraction, enabling the tree structure to be constructed. {\textcopyright} 2006 SPIE-IS{\&}T.},

Geography is different in every indoor map mainly after considering attenuation and space (3-D) factors. Most previous related research publications focus on signal attenuation but neglect other factors (e.g., reflections). Triangulation is a very popular method for device tracking but lacks precision. Graphic methods can provide more accurate results but translating their outcomes into machine-readable data can be challenging. In this paper, we survey most possible factors that affect indoor tracking and present a new deterministic formula to reduce ambiguity for reaching decisions. We propose the concept of Point of Interest that helps in scaling large-map analysis and in finding understudied locations; we present a formula that uses history data to build confidence. To test our formula, we built a test-bed and ran hundreds of experiments. Our results show large improvements in calculating distances between objects as well as making decisions on object locations. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper describes a detailed numerical simulation study of indoor propagation carried out in order to evaluate multipath effects on the GNSS repeater based indoor positioning approach in various environments. Previous work [1] studied multipath effects in a very restricted area of about 50 square meters with metallic walls. The goal of the present paper is to provide the required complementary information to evaluate the multipath problem in typical indoor environments and to propose some directions of optimisation. The theory of the GNSS repeater based approach, together with experimental results validating its principle, was presented in previous paper [2]. The main idea of this method consists in using GNSS repeaters in a sequential mode in order to carry out measurements of code phase jumps at the instant of transition from one repeater to the next. Once obtained, three such jumps allow the indoor location calculation, through a classical GNSS computation. In order to carry out multipath evaluation, and optimisation, we use a deterministic propagation simulation software called Ergospace. Some extensions and customized features of the simulation package were developed to make the software more suitable for the GNSS repeater approach. The software takes into account all the elements concerning the satellites, the antennas and the environment, and can be used for both static and dynamic simulations. The considered environment is completely described using VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language). Each object encountered in the environment (wall, ceiling, floor or furniture) is characterized by its geometrical and electrical properties. The patterns of all considered antennas were measured in 3D in order to have a precise description of their performances. The propagation is determined using Ray Tracing algorithms. In order to consider multipath, the interactions (reflections, transmissions and diffractions) between rays and the considered environment are calculated until a maximum number is reached. Furthermore, the software is divided into two parts, the Outdoor Module and the Indoor Module. The main results given and discussed in the paper concern different aspects such as: • Various typical environments (exhibition halls, amphitheatres, office buildings, houses, laboratories, etc.) • Effect of limited displacements around a given location in order to evaluate the small scale variations of the multipath • Determination of criteria for an optimised deployment, depending on the environments, for both the repeater and the receiving antennas • Impact of different radiation patterns for the repeater antennas (standard GPS antenna, directional antenna, etc.) First simulations are also carried out in a specific configuration where the repeaters are located outside the building and are transmitting indoors. Such a deployment could be envisaged in a situation of emergency for fire brigade or police operations in a building where no on site repeaters are available.},

abstract = {The pipes of a ship, which exist in heterogeneous typology and massive number, are one of the key elements in a shipyard, and their real-Time monitoring constitutes a prospective Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Their improved location, from production and through their lifetime, can enhance shipyard productivity and safety. Navantia, one of the ten largest shipbuilders in the world, has improved its pipe workshop thanks to the concept of smart pipe, which is defined as an object able to transmit signals periodically that allows for providing added-value services in a shipyard. In this paper it is evaluated the use of passive UHF RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) for implementing the concept of smart pipe. Promising indoor positioning results obtained in a pipe workshop are presented, showing that multi-Antenna algorithms and Kalman filtering can help to stabilize Received Signal Strength (RSS) and improve the overall accuracy of the pipe monitoring system in a real-world scenario. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) typically consist of a large number of densely populated sensor nodes. Due to important advances in integrated circuits and radio technologies, the use of distributed sensor networks is becoming increasingly widespread for a variety of applications, e.g. indoor navigation, environmental monitoring, people and object tracking, logistics, industrial diagnostics, quality control, and other manufacturing activities. In many cases, such as in objects tracking, knowing the physical location of network nodes is essential. Locating elements of WSNs is not a trivial task. Manual methods are wearisome and may be inaccurate, especially for large-scale networks. Therefore, many self-locating methods - where nodes cooperate with each other without human involvement - have recently been studied and implemented. The purpose of this work is to analyse the most significant methods for automatic location of distributed WSNs. The first part of the paper provides a description of the most common criteria used to categorize existing network localization algorithms. A taxonomy is then suggested that may be a useful tool to help evaluate, compare and select such algorithms. Five of the most representative algorithms are explained and discussed in detail in order to identify their strong points and their limitations.},

abstract = {Determining physical location of indoor objects is one of the key issues in development of context-aware applications in ubiquitous computing environments. This is mainly because context information obtained from sensor networks is meaningful only when the physical location of the context information source is determined. Recently, several indoor location information systems, such as Active Bat and Cricket, have been developed for precise indoor object localization. However, to provide accurate physical location tracking in large-scale space, those systems requires a lot of manual configuration for all the ultrasonic sensor nodes. To reduce configuration costs, we developed a new indoor positioning system called DOLPHIN. The DOLPHIN system consists of distributed wireless sensor nodes which are capable of sending and receiving RF and ultrasonic signals. These nodes are attached to various indoor objects. And using a novel distributed positioning algorithm in the nodes, DOLPHIN enables autonomous positioning of the objects with minimal manual configuration. This paper describes the design and implementation of the DOLPHIN system, and evaluates basic performance through several experiments in an indoor environment. {\textcopyright} 2003 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper describes the algorithm for positioning of both indoor base stations and pedestrians in nanoLOC (IEEE 802.15.4a) wireless network. The algorithm uses three sources of information: Time-of-flight ranging results between a mobile tag and base stations, the trajectory obtained from an embedded inertial measurement unit, and the map of the building. The iterative algorithm consists of two consequent interconnected stages. The particle filter is used to localize the mobile object on the map, whereas the discrete Bayes filter (grid filter) is applied for estimating the positions of base stations. Time-of-flight non-line-of-sight error distribution function was used as a likelihood in the discrete Bayes filter. Simulation shows that the described SLAM algorithm can be effectively used for setting the initial positions of base stations on the predefined map to save the installation time without significant decrease of localization accuracy. The proposed technique was applied in RealTrac local positioning technology. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {One of the most significant topics under extensive research in ubiquitous computing is indoor localization and mapping. The current outdoor techniques using GSM, GPS and Wi-Fi are very expensive and infeasible for indoor mapping. This document presents a unique method of real time indoor localization and mapping using digitally coded electromagnetic waves (ASK and FSK). Localization is acquired with respect to 2-D array (NxM) of transmitter modules in rows and columns (i.e. length and breadth of the indoor region). All the transmitters of row array are tuned at same frequency but each transmitter emits a unique 12 bit digital code. Same is the case with column transmitters. The geometrical wave model of these transmitters renders family of circles, where radius of each circle represents 'Received Signal Strength Indicator' (RSSI) value corresponding to a particular transmitter. For locating the object in (NxM) grid, differential mechanism is used i.e. comparing RSSI values of all the adjacent transmitters of row and column respectively at the location of object. Indoor region of particular dimensions can be discretized into NxM grids. Object is installed with customized FPGA core, 2 RF demodulators (for row and column) and two PLL ICs for calculating RSSI values (in 4 bit resolution). For real time response, 2 parallel I2C buses are connected to FPGA core. Wireless control over RF transmitters is used to prevent unwanted RF radiation. Overall, real world is discretized into grids. Also detailed comparison is shown as to how this technique is better than triangulation method. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {The place recognition problem comprises two distinct subproblems; recognizing a specific location in the world ('specific' or 'ordinary' place recognition) and recognizing the type of place (place categorization). Both are important competencies for mobile robots and have each received significant attention in the robotics and computer vision community, but usually as separate areas of investigation. In this paper, we leverage the powerful complementary nature of place recognition and place categorization processes to create a new hybrid place recognition system that uses place context to inform place recognition. We show that semantic place categorization creates an informative natural segmenting of physical space that in turn enables significantly better place recognition performance in comparison to existing techniques. In particular, this new semantically-informed approach adds robustness to significant local changes within the environment, such as transitioning between indoor and outdoor environments or between dark and light rooms in a house, complementing the capabilities of current condition-invariant techniques that are robust to globally consistent change (such as day to night cycles). We perform experiments using 4 novel benchmark datasets and show that semantically-informed place recognition outperforms the previous state-of-the-art systems. Like it does for object recognition [1], we believe that semantics can play a key role in boosting conventional place recognition and navigation performance for robotic systems. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Detection of objects in cluttered indoor environments is one of the key enabling functionalities for service robots. The best performing object detection approaches in computer vision exploit deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to simultaneously detect and categorize the objects of interest in cluttered scenes. Training of such models typically requires large amounts of annotated training data which is time consuming and costly to obtain. In this work we explore the ability of using synthetically generated composite images for training state-of-the-art object detectors, especially for object instance detection. We superimpose 2D images of textured object models into images of real environments at variety of locations and scales. Our experiments evaluate different superimposition strategies ranging from purely image-based blending all the way to depth and semantics informed positioning of the object models into real scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these object detector training strategies on two publicly available datasets, the GMUKitchens [5] and the Washington RGB-D Scenes v2 [11]. As one observation, augmenting some hand-labeled training data with synthetic examples carefully composed onto scenes yields object detectors with comparable performance to using much more hand-labeled data. Broadly, this work charts new opportunities for training detectors for new objects by exploiting existing object model repositories in either a purely automatic fashion or with only a very small number of human-annotated examples. {\textcopyright} 2017 MIT Press Journals.

abstract = {Diverse security applications often require monitoring of a narrow passage, such as an indoor corridor, a tunnel, a bridge; either to protect critical assets at the end of such a passage or to control the passage over it, or both. Often, sensors are arranged in a vector along such a passage and are capable of registering the crossing of a target but not its identity. In this paper, we consider coordinated tracking by such a vector of sensors where each sensor learns timings of objects passing at monitored spots from its predecessors. Hence, the problem we are solving could be formulated as an assignment or matching of target identities to arrival times of the targets at the subsequent sensors in a vector. We introduce a cost function that is the sum of squares of the difference between each target's predicted and observed arrival time at each sensor. We use target's speed as computed from the arrival times of the target at previous two sensors to predict the time of arrival at the current sensor. In such a scheme, the simple matching algorithm that sorts predicted and actual arrival times in two separated lists and then matches both lists by positions minimizes this and similar cost functions for each sensor locally in {\textless}i{\textgreater}O{\textless}/i{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}/i{\textgreater} log {\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) time. We have also developed more costly algorithms that yield higher quality global solution at the cost of communication, computation and memory. In the paper, we evaluate analytically, and by simulations, different variants of this matching algorithm and their complexity and performance.},

Such research extends the typical functionality of micro air vehicles (MAV) from passive observation and sensing to dynamic interaction with the environment. To achieve this, three major challenges are overcome: precise positioning, sensing and manipulation of the object, and stabilization in the presence of disturbance due to interaction with the object. Navigation in unstructured, GPS-denied environments is achieved using a visual SLAM algorithm that relies on an onboard monocular camera. A secondary camera, capable of detecting infrared light sources, is used to estimate the 3D location of the object, while an under-actuated and passively compliant manipulator is designed for effective gripping under uncertainty. The system utilizes nested PID controllers for attitude stabilization, vision-based navigation and gripping. The quadrotor is therefore able to autonomously navigate, locate and grasp an object, using only onboard sensors. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a series of tests and analyses undertaken to investigate the performance capabilities of an active RFID system (Freaquent{\textregistered}) for asset tracking and personal mobility. The RFID system was tested exhaustively considering a number of user requirements including maximum operating distance, antenna orientation, position accuracy, the influences caused by nearby objects and the operating environment. For this purpose, various positioning techniques were applied based on the lateration and fingerprinting positioning concepts. Analysis revealed that the lateration technique is sensitive to operational environment; however, as long as a representative “RSS to distance” model is established the method can deliver accuracies of the order of 0.7 m at unobstructed line-of-sight conditions. Location fingerprinting has shown that large temporal variations can occur partly which effect the radio maps of RSS distributions significantly. Thus, RSS training measurements have to performed at regular intervals to guarantee acceptable positioning accuracies on the meter-level.},

Their activity provides an internal measure of localization. A simple set of place-action associations enable a robot to go back to a learned location or to follow an arbitrary visual path. The system is able to achieve sensory-motor tasks in indoor as well as in large outdoor environments with similar computation load.

abstract = {Object recognition in the video sequence or images is one of the subfield of computer vision. Moving object recognition from a video sequence is an appealing topic with applications in various areas such as airport safety, intrusion surveillance, video monitoring, intelligent highway, etc. Moving object recognition is the most challenging task in intelligent video surveillance system. In this regard, many techniques have been proposed based on different methods. Despite of its importance, moving object recognition in complex environments is still far from being completely solved for low resolution videos, foggy videos, and also dim video sequences. All in all, these make it necessary to develop exceedingly robust techniques. This paper introduces multiple moving object recognition in the video sequence based on LoG Gabor-PCA approach and Angle based distance Similarity measures techniques used to recognize the object as a human, vehicle etc. Number of experiments are conducted for indoor and outdoor video sequences of standard datasets and also our own collection of video sequences comprising of partial night vision video sequences. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves an excellent recognition rate.

abstract = {We introduce Interactive Question Answering (IQA), the task of answering questions that require an autonomous agent to interact with a dynamic visual environment. IQA presents the agent with a scene and a question, like: "Are there any apples in the fridge?" The agent must navigate around the scene, acquire visual understanding of scene elements, interact with objects (e.g. open refrigerators) and plan for a series of actions conditioned on the question. Popular reinforcement learning approaches with a single controller perform poorly on IQA owing to the large and diverse state space. We propose the Hierarchical Interactive Memory Network (HIMN), consisting of a factorized set of controllers, allowing the system to operate at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. To evaluate HIMN, we introduce IQUAD V1, a new dataset built upon AI2-THOR [35], a simulated photo-realistic environment of configurable indoor scenes with interactive objects. IQUAD V1 has 75,000 questions, each paired with a unique scene configuration. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms popular single controller based methods on IQUAD V1.

The novelty of the proposed modified algorithm is that it does not need the perfect knowledge of camera parameters. A new definition of the scaling factor has been introduced in the scaled orthographic projection. Due to the peculiarity of the indoor bounded workspace a new formulation of the translation vector has been used. The new method has been successfully applied in a real environment considering a goal-directed navigation task for our real robot Khepera.

These images collected are used to create a three-dimensional model of the interior of the room by photogrammetric methods.

The research starts with radio signal strength indicator analysis along the corridor in order to create a path loss model for iBeacon. Two cases are taken into account: line of sight and non-line of sight for model creation. For both cases two tests: Chi-square, Shapiro-Wilk have been performed. It has also been checked if the HCI (Host Controller Interface) is a source with a memory. Acquired data have been filtered with different type of filters, e.g. median, moving average and then compared. Next, the authors evaluated the indoor positioning trilateration algorithms with the use of created model for exemplary hall. The RSSI map (radiomap) was created and the logarithm propagation model was designed. The logarithmic model estimated distance with average error 1.09m for 1 - 9m and 1.75m for 1-20m and after trilateration, the positions with average error 2.45m was achieved. A statistical analysis for acquiring data led to the final conclusion which enhanced knowledge about positioning based on the popular iBeacon technology. {\textcopyright} 2016 Damian E.

The main aim of this study is to get the most accurate way of filtering circular motion for the UWB system for statistical terms. Filtration presented in this paper can be used to locate objects using ultra-wideband technology, and thanks to the use of motion at speed up to 50km/h, it will be possible to use test results to reflect drones or autonomous vehicles, particularly where standard locations systems (e.g. GPS) is not available - such as tunnels, underground car parks, shopping centers. This document proposes an approach based on the filtration points that was assigned to the buckets placed in three-dimensional space on the expected trajectory of the circular object movement. During the data processing the following filters have been used: median, arithmetic mean, Savitzky-Golay in combination with arithmetic mean, and moving average in combination with arithmetic mean. The number of used measurement buckets, as well as their size, was also analyzed. The results were compared with the use of the length of the line, that traces the localized object in correlation with the number of measured buckets used.},

As the experiments prove, Cicada can provide the average 5 cm location precision both for static objects and for mobile objects, owns a nearly omni-directional working area ranging from -90 degree to +90 degree. Besides, it is able to run independently, mini and light so that it is convenient to be portable and even embedded into people s paraphernalia. Further, it is also flexible in scalability, for neither quantity range nor constraint of structure form is demanded on its infrastructure. Last, it is fairly facile to be employed, attributing to the wireless connectivity in its infrastructure.

The images of two ceiling cameras were stitched by using methods of image stitching. A core process of image mosaic is adjusting intensity and seeking optimal seam line. The optimal seam line was computed to avoid the moving object, which solved the abnormal stitching caused by parallax influence. Our experiment was divided into two stages: preparation and test.

RFID devices commonly are attached to persons or to moveable objects so that the objects can be tracked by using fixed readers (special-purpose radio receivers) at different locations. In this project, we explore the "flip side" of this practice. Our concept is that detection of RFID devices in known, fixed locations by a moving reader provides a precise indication of location for tracking the person or moving object that is carrying the reader.

Based on a semantic model about furniture objects (represented in an OWL-DL ontology with rules attached), we generate hypotheses for locations and 6DoF poses of object instances and verify them by matching a geometric model of the object (given as a CAD model) into the point cloud. The result, in addition to the registered point cloud, is a consistent mesh representation of the environment, further enriched by object models corresponding to the detected pieces of furniture. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach against occlusion and aperture limitations of the RGB-D frames, and against differences between the CAD models and the real objects. We evaluate the complete system on two challenging datasets featuring partial visibility and totaling over 800 frames. The results show complementary strengths and weaknesses of processing each frame directly vs. processing the fully registered scene, which accord with intuitive expectations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Robust tracking of a human in a video sequence is an essential prerequisite to an increasing number of applications, where a robot needs to interact with a human user or operates in a human-inhabited environment. This paper presents a robust approach that enables a mobile robot to detect and track a human using an onboard RGB-D sensor. Such robots could be used for security, surveillance, and assistive robotics applications. The proposed approach has real-time computation power through a unique combination of new ideas and well-established techniques. In the proposed method, background subtraction is combined with depth segmentation detector and template matching method to initialize the human tracking automatically. A novel concept of head and hand creation based on depth of interest is introduced in this paper to track the human silhouette in a dynamic environment, when the robot is moving. To make the algorithm robust, a series of detectors (e.g., height, size, and shape) is utilized to distinguish target human from other objects. Because of the relatively high computation time of the silhouette-matching-based method, a confidence level is defined, which allows using the matching-based method only where it is imperative. An unscented Kalman filter is used to predict the human location in the image frame to maintain the continuity of the robot motion. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through a real experiment on a mobile robot navigating in an indoor environment.},

abstract = {With the advancement in the technology, objects can be represented effectively in their 3D digital models which accurately represents their physical counterparts. Navigation services and mapping based on geographical data have become very popular in supporting our everyday lives. Much of these services are currently available mostly for outdoor purposes, however applications for indoor purposes are being explored where most of the human activities takes place. This can help transform cities into "Smart Cities". The aim of this study is to develop an indoor mapping system for data collection in a building environment by exploring new, efficient and cost effective scanning devices. The conventional devices currently in use are expensive which makes them difficult to implement for large scale applications. The data will be collected using a 3D scanning camera technology which develops depth maps of various locations. Xbox's Kinect Sensor and Stereolab's ZED camera are being used and compared in this study. Comparisons based on resolution, lighting, accuracy, speed and memory are being made in this study. Their pros and cons over conventional scanning devices are also discussed. The study shows the possibility of using this technology in a large scale building environment in an autonomous method for the future. This technology can then be potentially used for commercial purposes especially to track progress at construction sites, security purposes, facility management, retail and augmented reality applications. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {A novel patent pending change detection system (CDS) is presented. We define change detection system as a system that scans the environment and compares, in real time, the current scan with previous scans. This system has both military and civilian robotic applications. It is may be used for detecting changes in fences and their surrounding. It is useful for navigating out doors as well as indoors with no GPS. It is used with collaboration with the European community for a robot inside buildings with crowded areas like airports. Our laser CDS compares pixel by pixel of the environment uses laser collimated beams, so that the resolution is fairly constant (choosing the system parameters so that diffraction effects do not cause great discrepancy) over the whole range. An alarm is given only if the pixel has been really changed. In addition, the use of NIR fiber laser and gating technologies, allows us to operate in day/night and various adverse conditions and exploit the 3D nature of the laser range finder capability. Other solutions like video CDS do not compete with these capabilities. Our system demonstrates relatively high resolution, yet being capable of detecting changes while on the move and operating in about 100 meter environments. The resolution is achieved with accurate laser scanners. The laser CDS is based on three laser scanners. Two lasers are used for calculating the location and attitude of the car with laser scanners. This is achieved by scanning horizontally and vertically a long reference object such as the poles and wires in the case of a fence (or fence like objects) in outdoor applications - or the various openings, corners and entrances of various kinds walls and corridors in indoor applications. All this is possible with the help of appropriate LUT s prepared in a suitable calibration stage. The third laser is used for scanning the surrounding of the fence and is used for change detection. The basic scan, which is the reference for the change detection is obtained in the above mentioned calibration stage. Our feasibility demonstration system was built and driven on railroad along a fence, built for the experiment. The calibration results are shown; the scanning of the fence and its surrounding is clearly demonstrated during the motion of the car. Change detection is demonstrated using object placed near the fence. Our preliminary results clearly show the great potential of the system.},

The major originality of such a representation comes from its human origin. In our specific disabled-oriented application, the on-board person is used as an "intelligent sensor" which provides the system with some pertinent prior knowledge of its environment. No current sensor is able to provide information such as shape, dimensions and location relative evaluation of obstacles, etc. with such accuracy and rapidity. Using a man-made representation raises the problem of uncertainties in interpretation and evaluation. Our solution consists in using proximity relations between the geometrical primitives of the object, thus simply modeling human behavior when representing the surrounding. The dynamic aspect of multivalue number coding is used for the first time which allows real-time alterations of the encoded objects. The proposed dynamic modeling process has been tested in a real indoor environment using an experimental wheelchair equipped with ultrasonic sensors and a dead-reckoning system.},

abstract = {This paper describes our current work in developing a vision-based tracking and trajectory prediction system for an aerial robot based on low-cost digital cameras, image processing techniques, and a filtering and prediction algorithm. The system determines the pose (location and orientation) of a miniature airship, online during indoor flight, and will be used in a development framework for a future autonomous flight control system. Object localization is achieved by tracking an infra-red target array mounted to a model airship. Its pose in three-dimensional space can be computed from corresponding points in the images of two cameras which are calibrated in a global coordinate system. The calibration procedure and the localization, as well as some aspects of the measurement accuracy achieved, are discussed. Real-world applications provide an uncertain static or dynamic environment which complicates the tracking of a target. To overcome problems due to noisy data or even failed target detection in image frames, a filtering procedure is applied for estimating the airship's pose. In a first step, points in the two-dimensional image planes are directly tracked and propagated forward to the vehicle pose. In a second step, an adaptive noise Kalman filter is applied for estimating and predicting the flight trajectory. Its state is propagated back to points in the image planes to guide the detection algorithm by defining regions of confidence. Both approaches are combined in a tracking algorithm. In-flight measurements are used to validate the parameters of the adaption procedure. Some experimental results are shown.},

abstract = {The field reporting methods in the architecture/engineering/construction and facility management (AEC/FM) industry are in the middle of a major change in terms of how tasks are being conducted in the field. One of the key components in this trend is the reliable capability of localizing distant target objects in need of monitoring and documentation without preinstalled systems in any built environments including Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless-denied indoor and outdoor environments. This paper proposes a new infrastructure-free approach for three-dimensional (3D) localization of distant target objects by integrating the following two sources of information on a mobile device: (1) embedded motion sensors in the mobile device such as an accelerometer and gyroscope - localizing a user equipped with the mobile device through the probabilistic integration of multiple dead-reckoning paths, which provides the location information of each camera center in the global coordinate system; and (2) an embedded visual sensor (i.e., camera) - localizing distant target objects of interest through the image-based 3D localization by leveraging photos taken from multiviews for the objects. To test the proposed method, several case studies were conducted in an existing instructional facility, and approximately 3{\%} of the averaged distance errors were reported. Experimental results promise that the proposed multimodal mobile sensing and analytics have significant potential to robustly localize distant in-building assets and reduce the drift errors accumulated in proportion to the moving distance. In addition, the stereoscopic view provides more semantics on the distant target objects, which enables practitioners to improve the associated situational awareness about their performance (e.g., the as-is physical condition). The perceived benefits of the proposed mobile computing system and related open research challenges are discussed in detail. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {During recent years, the use of real-time location tracking technologies has increased immensely in many industries. Many GPS based apps such as Google maps are widely being used almost everywhere for this purpose. However despite being widely used these apps can only be helpful for tracking locations that can be found on geographical map i.e. outdoor locations only. Whereas in order to locate a position in an indoor environment, GPS shows a lot of inconsistencies, therefore, it calls for using an entirely different approach. This is due to the higher diversity of the semantic interpretations by which closed environments are characterized. This fact makes the visual contact with the GPS satellite difficult hence making GPS technology an unreliable technique for determining positions of objects in indoor places. Hence for efficiently tracking such locations, many other technologies are being used. This research provides a thematic analysis of various indoor positioning applications that are developed based on different technologies. This paper also includes a practical implementation of an indoor positioning technique that is best suitable for locating positions of objects in a shopping mart's navigation module.},

To obtain the camera locations in a metric coordinate system, the metric scale of the point cloud has to be known. This contribution describes a method to calculate the metric scale for a point cloud of an indoor environment, like a parking garage, by fusing multiple individual scale values. The individual scale values are calculated from structures and objects with a-priori known metric extension, which can be identified in the unscaled point cloud. Extensions of building structures, like the driving lane or the room height, are derived from density peaks in the point distribution. The extension of objects, like traffic signs with a known metric size, are derived using projections of their detections in images onto the point cloud. The method is tested with synthetic image sequences of a drive with a front-looking mono camera through a virtual 3D model of a parking garage. It has been shown, that each individual scale value improves either the robustness of the fused scale value or reduces its error. The error of the fused scale is comparable to other recent works. {\textcopyright} Authors 2018.},

The cognitive robotic system has demonstrated how the Soar cognitive architecture can be integrated with common robotic motor and perceptual systems that complement the strengths of Soar for unmanned vehicle control. The cognitive robotic system has been tested using an indoor search mission, during which the cognitive robotic system searches a building for common intersection types and an object of interest using information from robotic mapping, computer vision, and fuzzy logic algorithms. The Soar agent builds a topological map of the environment, using information about the intersections the cognitive robotic system detects, and it uses this topological model to make intelligent decisions about how to effectively search the building. Once the object of interest has been detected, the Soar agent uses the topological map to make decisions about how to efficiently return to the location where the mission started as well as to generate step-by-step directions using the intersections in the environment as landmarks that describe a direct path from the mission's start location to the object of interest.

abstract = {As location systems provide increasingly fine-grained locations for mobile entities, location-aware systems that react appropriately and autonomously to location events will be in demand. Although much research has been devoted to indexing schemes for very large scale GIS applications (where the systems are predominantly query-based), comparably little attention has been given to the use of spatial indexing within location-aware systems leveraging local positioning systems (predominantly event-based). This paper reviews the notion of spatial indexing (the representation of a tracked user's space to facilitate spatial event generation based on incoming locations) for event-based systems. It establishes the principles and requirements of a wide-area spatial indexer, reviews the R-tree, Quadtree and RQ-tree methods proposed before for indoor location-awareness, and significantly adapts the latter to meet the requirements. The proposed indexing method uses a combination of R-trees (for high level spatial information, down to structural level) and Quadtrees (for lower level representation of objects). It proposes the use of linear Quadtrees to exploit the ease of direct node movement rather than the re-rasterisation of polygons used in systems to date. This approach is compared in simulation with other approaches.},

abstract = {A system has been developed to enable a robot vehicle to autonomously explore and map an indoor environment using only visual sensors. The vehicle is equipped with a single camera, whose output is wirelessly transmitted to an off-board standard PC for processing. Visual features within the camera imagery are extracted and tracked, and their 3D positions are calculated using a Structure from Motion algorithm. As the vehicle travels, obstacles in its surroundings are identified and a map of the explored region is generated. This paper discusses suitable criteria for assessing the performance of the system by computer-based simulation and practical experiments with a real vehicle. Performance measures identified include the positional accuracy of the 3D map and the vehicle's location, the efficiency and completeness of the exploration and the system reliability. Selected results are presented and the effect of key system parameters and algorithms on performance is assessed.

abstract = {The importance of location based services (LBS) has largely increased for consumer applications and becoming more and more relevant in industrial applications. For example location dependent information can support occupational safety staff to ensure the safety at work in emergency scenarios. In outdoor environments localization can be obtained easily by using a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). For harsh indoor environments, however, where most industrial applications require localization, an accurate localization remains a challenge in general. In this paper we present a hybrid localization system enabling navigation in challenging environments. The hybrid system fuses received signal strength (RSS) based wireless sensor network (WSN) ranging and a foot mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU). The key contribution of this paper is a hybrid localization concept and experimental results using a deployed system in an industrial environment. We characterize the wireless sensor network signal propagation and evaluate the magnetic field for heading stabilization in such environments. The accuracy analysis shows a typical error of 2 meters. In comparison to a pure inertial navigation system (INS) approach, we demonstrate the enhancements introduced by the combination of an inertial navigation system and a wireless sensor network received signal strength based localization.},

Logistics on a construction site, for example, can be optimized by finding the most efficient route, to ensure on the point deliveries and further tracking of delivered goods. Although a key factor for their appliance is a tight cost-value ratio. Therefore localization systems need to conciliate constraints from the application-specific and the system's inherent properties. The availability of electrical power, the network density, the lifetime of the localization system and its accuracy represent an example of conditioned constraints, especially in dynamic environments with no fixed infrastructure. In this paper, we present an energy aware two-staged localization concept, considering power and cost constraints while preserving high position update rates and long system lifetimes. For this purpose a low power wireless sensor network is combined with a high update rate wireless sensor network.

In Present generation, an autonomous robot has been a popular technology which is widely used in many areas. Robots are used to share the work and act more autonomously in performing the jobs faster than humans. Usually, Robots are more intelligent with endless energy levels and more precise in handling the jobs perfectly. However, the proposed robot design is about researching and investigating hazardous environments, exploration, remote assistance and Military services. In the given system design, a robot system is built to monitor and identify the motion in achieving better security and surveillance of indoor environments. This autonomous system is built by using an embedded system to perform specific tasks and function as defined. This robotic system has five different systems such as robotic arms for pick and place of the objects from conveyor belts, an ultrasonic sensor for distance calculation, a visionary system for recording the motion of invader and sending the pictures through video transmission system through a network. Fire sensor is used for detection of fire and a giving alarm in the environment. The location of the robotic system is defined with GPS longitude and latitude values. This information is sent through a network using things speak and the same information is displayed on the LCD. A GSM message is sent through mobile for giving an alert about the operation. The robot designed has two modes of operation. One is the autonomous mode, and the other is the manual mode using a remote supervisory system. The deigned work combines the sensory and remote supervising system for better robotic security. The path planning is also carried out in a robotic system for achieving the motion in real time and obstacle avoidance.

Due to the complex nature of indoor space modeling (i.e. re-creating floor plans), the applicability of indoor LBS has been limited to few big installations such as airports, big shopping centers, etc. To facilitate the growth of indoor LBSs to end users, we overcome this major limitation of indoor space recreation by automatically converting an AutoCad DXF file, the most widely used design format, to a Spatialite database for smartphones. We develop algorithms that first pre-process the data from a DXF file and then effectively recognize rooms, doors, corridors and obstacles, and finally convert these objects for indoor space navigation through smartphones.

This paper suggests a novel algorithm, using the RFID-system, to support one reader for localizing target tags amid the clutter of indoor interference environments, based on the metrics of the received signal strength and the time of flight. This algorithm attempts to specify the target tag among four-nearest neighbors as the four-reference tags, and adapt the weighted-center of gravity technique. The method provides a level of accuracy of about 1.07 m as the total error average of positioning 10-target tags in various interference environments that are generated on all sector-functions. The total error averages of the 3-6 sectors functions are 1.18 m, 0.74 m, 1.6 m, and 0.78 m on one reader in an area of 12 m by 10 m. The effects of interference in the simulation indicated that the accuracy is better for the even-sector-functions as the input-signals' generator for this algorithm.},

However, many problems remain to be solved in the development of autonomous robots that can work like humans. When a robot moves, it is important that it be able to have self-localization abilities and recognize obstacles. For a human, the present location can be correctly checked through a comparison between memorized information assuming, it is correct, and the present situation. In addition, the distance to an object and the perception of its size can be estimated by a sense of distance based on memory or experience. Therefore, the environment for robotic activity assumed in this study was a finite-space such as a family room, an office, or a hospital room. Because an accurate estimation of position is important to the success of a robot, we have developed a navigation system with self-localization ability which uses only a CCD camera that can detect whether the robot is moving accurately in a room or corridor.

In addition, we used only natural landmarks such as walls, because we assumed that the environment was a human one. In this article we discuss and explain two modules: a self-position recognition system and an obstacle recognition system. In both systems, the recognition is based on image processing of the sight information provided by the robot's camera.

abstract = {Unlike standard object classification, where the image to be classified contains one or multiple instances of the same object, indoor scene classification is quite different since the image consists of multiple distinct objects. Furthermore, these objects can be of varying sizes and are present across numerous spatial locations in different layouts. For automatic indoor scene categorization, large-scale spatial layout deformations and scale variations are therefore two major challenges and the design of rich feature descriptors which are robust to these challenges is still an open problem. This paper introduces a new learnable feature descriptor called 'spatial layout and scale invariant convolutional activations' to deal with these challenges. For this purpose, a new convolutional neural network architecture is designed which incorporates a novel 'spatially unstructured' layer to introduce robustness against spatial layout deformations. To achieve scale invariance, we present a pyramidal image representation. For feasible training of the proposed network for images of indoor scenes, this paper proposes a methodology, which efficiently adapts a trained network model (on a large-scale data) for our task with only a limited amount of available training data. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on a number of data sets, including MIT-67, Scene-15, Sports-8, Graz-02, and NYU data sets. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {In TOA based indoor geolocation systems ranging error is a function of the bandwidth of the system and the availability of the direct path between the transmitter and the receiver. With a Detected Direct Path (DDP) condition and UWB transmission, precise range estimates are feasible while in Undetected Direct Path (UDP) conditions large ranging errors occur which can not be cured with the increase of the transmission power or bandwidth. This paper uses Markov chain and the results of measurement calibrated Ray Tracing with 500MHz bandwidth in a typical office environment to introduce a novel model for the behavior of the ranging errors observed by a randomly moving mobile terminal in an indoor area. The model divides the behavior of the ranging error into three categories. The first is DDP where the errors are usually small and mainly caused by multipath. The second category, Natural UDP (NUDP), is caused by path-loss and exhibits medium ranging errors. The third category, Shadowed UDP (SUDP), is caused by objects blocking the direct path and demonstrates very large ranging errors. Parameters of the Markov model are calculated from the results of wideband channel characteristics for different locations of a mobile. Results of the simulated errors from the modeling and the actual errors from the channel profile show close agreement. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Although there have been many proposals to provide physical location, these have had several restrictions such as dependence on the type and size of objects and trade-offs between location accuracy and the number of sensing devices. We propose an approach to removing these restrictions using mobile detectors. This paper describes the design of a goods tracking system called MobiTra that estimates the locations of any indoor objects using detection histories sent by mobile detectors. MobiTra is separated by several components and two data flows. A prototype for MobiTra was developed using an active RF system and Cricket, which can obtain a high degree of accuracy. We evaluated how accurately MobiTra estimated location in an environment that generated MTR errors. The errors affected the size of the estimated area and its position. We propose a new method of estimating location to be used in environments that generate MTR errors.},

abstract = {We consider a wireless data access scenario where a centralized server provides data items to its clients with a fee. To reduce the total charges incurred, clients perform "peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing" - clients exchange data items at a lower cost. Specifically, P2P sharing cost is determined by two factors: energy and bandwidth. Neighboring clients share data objects among themselves if it is mutually beneficial. This would inevitably lead to reduced server's revenue. We investigate the effectiveness in using pricing as a strategy for the server to indirectly regulate the amount of P2P sharing. We propose an auction pricing mechanism that allows clients to bid for their desired data objects. Simulation results show that the proposed pricing strategy effectively deters sharing in lightly-loaded network while judiciously leverages sharing when the network is congested},

abstract = {In order to simplify processes in logistics, warehousing, and surveillance, our interdisciplinary joint project AmbiSense has combined solutions for efficient acquisition and mapping of environments. These environments are equipped with diverse ambient technology such as WLAN, Bluetooth, and RFID. The research is based on techniques stemming from the fields of robotics, embedded systems, augmented reality (AR) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).More precisely, we present a novel complete system for machine-aided inventory. Our system covers automatic product identification using RFID, localization based on ambient sensors, the enrichment of raw RFID data with product information from ERP backend systems and real-time augmented reality visualization.One key component of our project is the continuous integration of all developed algorithms and techniques into a real-world demonstrator to illustrate their practicability and usefulness. We have chosen warehousing and retail as our current application scenario: Robot-assisted inventory is applied in a supermarket as we expect goods to be labeled individually with RFID tags in the near future. This enables products to be tracked from production to sale consistently and to be localized permanently.In order to provide a working demonstrator, we set up an application scenario resembling a supermarket at the AmbiSense lab at the University of T{\"{u}}bingen. It consists of individually tagged products placed in typical shop shelves. Our robot, equipped with an RFID reader, traverses the supermarket environment while constantly detecting products within its range. The data are transmitted using WLAN to a central computer which holds a model of the current state of the system. We augment these data by additional product-specific information provided by the ERP system. The detected objects as well as additional product data are visualized using AR techniques.This scenario aims at synchronizing the product stock of supermarkets or stores automatically. Other sample tasks could be the identification of products that are past their sell-by dates or located in the wrong places.In addition the robot localizes itself using the existing infrastructure of different, cost-efficient ambient wireless sensors. To achieve the location we develop and combine novel positioning techniques using passive UHF RFID, Bluetooth, and WLAN. We thereby employ three orthogonal measuring techniques: detection rates, signal strength, and round trip time. The orthogonality of the methods is designed to achieve robustness to noise and unforeseen changes in the surroundings. Moreover, due to their different read ranges, the technologies can complement each other at different scales of the environment. An effective and cost-efficient indoor location solution can only be achieved with multiple and heterogeneous ambient sensors combined together. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

abstract = {Autonomous mapping systems execute multiple tasks that include navigation, location, and map generation via the collaborative work of multiple sensors. They are the object of a substantial research focus in the fields of robotics and remote sensing. Although the state-of-the-art mobile mapping systems typically found in readymade vehicles or robots are reliable, they are rather large and heavy, their cost is high, and they generally use GPS and an inertial measurement unit to position, so their working environments are limited. After reviewing the current state of autonomous mapping systems, we describe the design and development of a small and lightweight autonomousmapping system (ASQ-6DMapSys) without GPS, which incorporates low-cost sensors and components.We describe the layout and selection strategy for sensors and other components in detail, and we present the design methodology for each subsystem. The ASQ-6DMapSys employs a two-dimensional (2D) lidar, an inclinometer, and two wheel encoders, which constitute a pose subsystem that uses extended Kalman filtering and simultaneous localization and mapping techniques to compute the pose of the vehicle body. A lowcost 3D lidar that we developed is also installed on the vehicle body, and the resultant data are aligned with the corresponding pose data of the vehicle body to build a 3D point cloud that describes the global geometry of the environment.We designed and developed every subsystem of the ASQ-6DMapSys, including the robot vehicle, so it will be easy to expand its functions in the future. The ASQ-6DMapSys performs well in indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments, and the experiments in different environments show that the ASQ-6DMapSys is an effective, small, and lightweight autonomousmapping system with a high performance/price ratio. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel integrated background model for video surveillance. Our model uses a primal sketch representation for image appearance and 3D scene geometry to capture the ground plane and major surfaces in the scene. The primal sketch model divides the background image into three types of regions - flat, sketchable and textured. The three types of regions are modeled respectively by mixture of Gaussians, image primitives and LBP histograms. We calibrate the camera and recover important planes such as ground, horizontal surfaces, walls, stairs in the 3D scene, and use geometric information to predict the sizes and locations of foreground blobs to further reduce false alarms. Compared with the state-of-the-art background modeling methods, our approach is more effective, especially for indoor scenes where shadows, highlights and reflections of moving objects and camera exposure adjusting usually cause problems. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of background/foreground separation at pixel level, and the integrated video surveillance system at the object and trajectory level. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the advances in information and communication technologies, wireless sensor networks has made Ambient Intelligence (AmI) applications possible that can monitor the situation around the persons or objects and give certain responses for their needs. The location awareness is an important technology for AmI applications. The advantages of ZigBee wireless sensor networks such as low cost, high scalability, high availability and supporting dynamic routing topology make ZigBee more suitable for indoor location system. In this research, we propose a ZigBEe-bAsed indoor loCatiON (ZigBEACON) system for the AmI applications. The proposed approach is based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. According to the Received Signal Strength Indication's (RSSI) path loss distribution, the RSSI values are defined into four classes. The signals that belong to different classes will be adjusted by the different ratio and will be referred to as weighted RSSI. The use of weighted RSSI can effectively choose the p-nearest reference nodes. Finally, the position of mobile node would be derived by calculating the coordinates of p-nearest reference nodes. Comparing the results with that of ZigBee-based LANDMARC system, our approach has 29{\%} improvement on average error distance. The approach not only improves the accuracy, but also provides less calculation complexity than other improvement methods of LANDMARC. The ZigBEACON approach is an adequate solution to the indoor location system for AmI applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Building a senior citizen-friendly environment has become an important issue. On one hand, senior citizens are likely to forget where key items are placed due to hypomnesia. Life is inconvenient for them. On the other hand, the proportion of elderly living alone or living only with spouse increases.

The arisen of IoT is not only helpful to our daily life in terms of traffic and shopping, but also with clinical knowledge and experience is applicable to build the environment of health care and increase the quality of home care service for senior citizens.

abstract = {A BLE beacon is often used as a method for indoor positioning in the latest IoT technology. The calculation of a position by measuring the information from a beacon can bring about different measured values according to the signal strength and obstacles. A mobile device that receives information from a fixed beacon can also use the service. This study suggests a method to accurately measure the location of a portable beacon as against a fixed beacon, and uses ontology as a way of implementing this. The RSSI value is typically measured and used to calculate the distance of a beacon. Since accuracy can deteriorate due to noise and error, a given value is filtered through the Kalman filter algorithm. This value provides ontology by normalization through correlation analysis of the values. This ontology infers the location information of the moving beacon. It provides the ability to offer services for other users to distinguish an object with a beacon. This enables quick and accurate location identification and fulfills the demand for such indoor services. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Information Institute.},

abstract = {Designing mobile robots that navigate indoor environments autonomously is known to be a difficult problem. A critical issue is in the formulation of robust motion control algorithms capable of reliably sensing partial or incomplete information from the environment and using this information to choose appropriate actions to achieve its designed goals. As an example, suppose we wish to deploy a mobile robot that autonomously patrols defined locations at a hazardous high-security facility. The robot must maintain accurate knowledge of its location, while using sensory data to recognize objects and obstacles in its immediate vicinity. Its task is to inspect the desired locations within a defined time period and provide real-time data in the event of an incident. The problem is thus to choose appropriate actions that result in accomplishing the patrol in a minimal amount of time in the partially structured environment. To solve this problem we adopt the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) formalism to find near-optimal and efficient policies that provides a description the robot's motion in environments with incomplete state information. POMDP is a generalization of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It models a system as a coupling of an agent/decision maker (robots in our case) and an environment. We also present a methodology called Goal-Specific Representation (GSR) to reduce the size of the state-space for computational efficiency and propose an extension to the methodology.},

abstract = {We describe the design, implementation, and test of VIOLAS, a vision-based system for object location and occupancy sensing in sentient buildings. Sentient building operations require the existence of a dynamic and self-updating model of building context, components, spaces, systems, processes, and occupancy. Such a model can support applications in building and facility management as well as indoor environmental controls. Specifically, comprehensive self-updating models can facilitate the implementation of simulation-based building systems control strategies (e.g. for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting). Since the underlying model for such operations must possess the capability to autonomously update itself, a versatile sensing mechanism is required that provides context awareness, i.e., real-time facility state information. The research described in this paper aims to examine and demonstrate the potential of vision-based sensing solutions to meet this requirement. For the generation of a comprehensive, self-updating space model, the prototype system particularly requires object identification and location sensing as well as occupancy detection. Toward this end, VIOLAS offers a flexible and scalable arrangement of hardware and software components (tied together via internet), which is generally well-suited to the requirements of sentient buildings. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Within a manufacturing system, a smart human-machine interface reduces the chances of human error and helps users to make informed decisions, especially in critical situations. This paper presents a concept for a flexible context specific assistance system for industrial applications using camera based localization. As a central element, a modular and service oriented context aware system aggregates relevant data from different sources. An object recognition service applies image analysis techniques on a video stream, captured from a top mounted multi-camera system to detect a person's location and associate it with a mobile device. A semantically enriched OPC UA server provides access to process data, and a web-service provides connection to a user interface hosted on a tablet PC. A case study provides an application of the proposed solution for the maintenance support and indoor navigation is implemented as a proof of concept. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Moving objects, especially autonomous mobile robots, require information of indoor self-location with high accuracy to reach their destination safely and correctly. In this study, we aimed to measure the indoor position of a moving object using SS (spread spectrum) ultrasonic waves, and we discussed the accuracy of the moving distance measured using a newly developed hardware device. In the case of static object, we showed that because of the noise tolerance of SS waves, a distance up to 20 [m] could be measured between a transmitter and a receiver on cm-order. To detect the SS ultrasonic signals, correlation calculations were carried out between a range of received waves and same range of replica signals; the replica signals were the same as the transmitted SS signals. Popular positioning systems using SS electrical waves employ signal acquisition to calculate coordinates of objects from correlation values and signal tracking to measure the relative shift of distances of moving objects. It is difficult for the system using SS ultrasonic waves to continue tracking because of the decrease in the self-correlation value due to the Doppler effect that acted on a moving object. To solve this problem, we proposed a tracking method for keeping correlation values by limited range of correlation calculations. In this study, for obtaining real-time updates of positional information from the relative shift, an experiment of distance measurement was also conducted using a newly developed hardware device that was used to carry out signal acquisition and the proposed tracking method. The results show that real-time signal tracking with our method could be realized, same as existing software between +/- 0.5 [m/s]. This paper reports that we can expect self-localization of robots using this system. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {To expand the range of activities by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), whose use at disaster sites and other dangerous locations has raised high expectations, UAVs must be capable of several functions, e.g., flight both indoor and outdoor environments. This requires making the airframe and major sensors as compact and light-weight as possible. To do so, we are developing uniaxial laser rangefinders to replace conventional scanning laser rangefinders. One developmental approach to uniaxial laser rangefinders and results regarding their validity are reported in this paper. Using a simulated model – a modified scanning laser rangefinder – we discuss the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, this is to reduce the range drift due to heat, for which we propose using a multiecho to measure two echoes from a reference plate whose distance is known and that is placed outside of the sensor, and the target object, instead using the internal reference plate used in conventional two-dimensional scanning laser rangefinders. We also report the results of experiments verifying its validity. {\textcopyright} 2015, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Localization based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) is a key method for locating objects in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, current RSS-based methods are ineffective at both deployment and operation design levels. First, they usually require a labor-intensive pre-deployment profiling operations to map the RSS to either locations or distances. Second often rely on heavy processing operations. These two design problems limit the possibility of implementing such localization techniques on resource-constrained sensor nodes, and also restrict their scalability and use in practice. In this book chapter, we discuss the challenges and limitations of RSS-based localization mechanisms and we propose, EasyLoc, an autonomous and practical RSS-based localization technique that improves on previous approaches in terms of ease of deployment and ease of implementation, while still providing a reasonable accuracy. EasyLoc is a plug-and-play and fully distributed RSS-based localization method that requires zero pre-deployment configuration. The idea consists in exploiting the available distance information between anchors to derive an online and anchor-specific RSS to distance mapping. We show that, in addition to its simplicity, EasyLoc provides, in the best case, a reasonable average distance error of 2 m in an indoor environment of 30 m 2. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The time-varying, unstable nature of RF signals has limited the accuracy of RF-based indoor positioning techniques such as Wi-Fi fingerprinting. Positioning errors of over 10 meters are reported in large-scale indoor environment such as airport and department stores. Compared to RF or ultrasound signals, the geomagnetic field signal exhibits stable signal strength in time domain. However, the existing geomagnetic field based indoor localization still relies on the fingerprinting technique, which is borrowed from the RF-based indoor positioning. This cannot resolve the distribution of the same geomagnetic field values and thus became a major reason for diminished performance of geomagnetic- based indoor localization. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization technique that uses magnetometer sensor readings as input to the artificial neural network models. The idea is that although there can be multiple locations having the same magnetic field value, as a pedestrian moves the sequence of magnetic field values will lead to a unique pattern of the sensor readings over time. We use a recurrent neural network (RNN) since it can characterize a particular location based on the current input as well as the past sequence of inputs. We first build a geomagnetic field map on our campus test-bed. Then, we generate a million traces of various pedestrian walking patterns from the map. We use Google Tensorflow with NVIDIA cuDNN library as a Deep Learning framework. 95{\%} of the traces are used for training and 5{\%} of the traces are used for localization evaluation. In this preliminary evaluation, we show an average positioning error of 1.062 meters compared to the average error of 3.14 meters of our BLE fingerprinting results. We cannot only improve the localization accuracy but we are also able to address the problem of continuous route tracking, which was not possible with the RF-based fingerprinting. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {The complexity of indoor environments has made navigation difficult for vision impaired individuals as well as individuals with clear vision. Although handheld mobility devices have been developed to assist the vision impaired in navigation, they are incapable of capturing parameters such as distance, angle and direction. This paper presents an appraised framework; the Accessible Building Information Model (AccessBIM), which could be used for generating an indoor map in real-time with the classification of real world objects and their locations. The AccessBIM database is equipped with two optimization algorithms; a database optimization algorithm that reduces the time of query execution through indexing, query re-writing, schema redesigning and a memory optimization algorithm known as 'Memcache'. Five scenarios were tested using a simulator to determine the accuracy of the map that is generated. The use of the two algorithms ensured that the real-time map generated through the data collected from the simulation environment was similar to the actual floor plan. Hence, it can be concluded that the AccessBIM framework has the potential to play an integral role in assistive technologies related to localization and mapping, thus significantly improving the quality of life for individuals with vision impairment. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {A map is a basic component used in a part of navigation in everyday life, which helps people to find information regarding locations, landmarks, and routes. By GPS and online service map e.g. Google maps, navigating outdoors is easier. Inside buildings, however, navigating would not be so easy due to natural characteristics and limitations of GPS, which has led to the creations of indoor navigation system. Even though the indoor navigation systems have been developed for long time, there are still some limitation in accuracy, reliability and indoor spatial information. Navigating inside without indoor spatial information would be a challenge for the users. Regarding the indoor spatial information, a research question has been drawn on finding an appropriate framework towards map data representation of an indoor public spaces and buildings in order to promote indoor navigation for people, robotics, and autonomous systems. This paper has purposed a list of factors and components used towards the design framework for map data representation of indoor public spaces and buildings. The framework, in this paper, has been presented as a form of a multiple-layered model, which each layer designed for a different propose, with object and information classifications. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Wireless sensor network (WSN) has given its own individuality in tracking scenario. The challenges faced in this paper deals about an effective 2-dimensional movable system tracking and finding the possible prediction of its exact location of the object in the sensing area. An indoor based WSN with wireless sensor nodes has been created, in which RSSI based location sensing methodology is used. The sensing area is classified as shells and the movement of the node is judged with markov model. The proposed algorithm is tested with various speed conditions suitable for IoT applications. Real study shows the effectiveness of the proposed two dimensional algorithms. The obtained results show minimal location error and accurate location of the object. The proposed methodology serves as the better solution for IoT applications. The proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm with reduced error rate and computing iterations or complexity.

abstract = {Location positioning in indoor environments is a major challenge. Various algorithms have been developed over years to address the problem of indoor positioning. One of the most cost effective choice for indoor positioning is based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) using existing Wi-Fi networks in commercial and/or public areas. This solution is infrastructure-free and offers meter-range accuracy. In this paper, machine learning approaches including k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), a rules-based classifier (JRip), and random forest have been investigated to estimate the indoor location of a user or an object using RSSI based fingerprinting method. Experimental measurements were carried out using 1500 reference points with received RSSIs of 86 installed APs in the second floor of Centre for Engineering Innovation (CEI) building at the University of Windsor. The results indicate that the random forest classifier presents the best performance as compared to k-NN and JRip classifiers with positioning accuracy higher than 91{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

The Radio Map construction by fingerprints is of great importance for indoor localization. Existing methods of Radio Map construction have encountered bottlenecks in this area, which will limit the application of indoor localization technology due to the deployment is massive and cumbersome. The spatial correlation between RSSI observations is adopted and the manifold alignment algorithm will be adopted to locate the user's current location without a complete Radio Map so as to reduce the requirements of the calibration fingerprints.

abstract = {Some location-aware use cases imply that a person desires to find an object relative to his position. This is the case of museum visits or any indoors/outdoors activity where the objects of interest are not geo-referenced or even can move with time. For these use cases, a user does not need an absolute localization, but a relative information consisting of the range to the object and the heading angle between that object and the user's moving direction. In this paper we study two different radio technologies for finding an object of interest: Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Range and orientation estimation performance is studied when using just the distance or the Received-Signal-Strength (RSS) provided by UWB and BLE systems, respectively. Both approaches are combined with Pedestrian Dead-reckoning (PDR) estimation in order to analyze the benefits that PDR information provides. For completeness we compare the cases where only one tag is fixed to the object to locate (the simpler and more flexible case) with the more ideal case where several geo-referenced objects of interest, each one with a tag, jointly cooperate to improve the relative location to one of the objects of interest (in both cases the user carries a mobile phone with BLE 4.0 or UWB radio). The UWB ranging radio, not common in most smartphones, but very accurate, is used as our reference to define the best achievable performance goal, in order to compare with BLE RSS-based performance. We demonstrate that the common BLE low ranging-accuracy technology combined with smartphone-based PDR estimation is capable, after some initial user's walking, of finding with decent range and heading accuracy the objects of interest in a museum-like set-up.},

In this paper, based on indoor moving-object trajectories, we aim to detect hotspots from indoor trajectory data. Such information is helpful for users to understand the surrounding locations as well as to enable indoor trajectory mining and location recommendation. We first define a new kind of query called indoor hotspot query. Then, we introduce a pre-processing step to remove meaningless locations and obtain indoor stay trajectories. Further, we propose a new approach to answering indoor hotspot queries w.r.t. two factors: (1) users' interests in indoor locations, and (2) the mutual reinforcement relationship between users and indoor locations. Particularly, we construct a userlocation matrix and use an iteration-based technique to compute the hotness of indoor locations. We evaluate our proposal on 223,564 indoor tracking records simulating 100 users' movements over a period of one month in a six-floor building. The results in terms of MAP, P@n, and nDCG show that our proposal outperforms baseline methods like rank-by-visit, rank-by-density, and rank-byduration. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland, All rights Reserved.},

We decompose the action selection problem during the search into two parts. First, we compute a belief over the location of the object and subsequently use the belief to select the next target location the robot should visit. For the inference part, we utilize a maximum entropy model which models the conditional distribution over possible locations of the target object given the observations made so far. The model is based on co-occurrences of objects and object attributes in different spatial contexts. The parameters are learned by maximizing the data likelihood using gradient ascent. We evaluate our approach by simulated search runs based on data obtained from different real-world environments. Our results show a significant improvement over a standard search technique which does not employ domain-specific background knowledge.},

The ideal location system makes use of existing infrastructure such as wireless LAN or cellular communication systems. However, in indoor environment typical wireless LAN systems do not provide sufficient accuracy for many smart applications and such as WLAN based location system needs to be enhanced. This paper involves proposal of a heterogeneous location system based on a combination of IEEE 802.11 WLAN and a sensor network based ultra wideband radar system. The proposed system provides greater accuracy than other proposed systems and provides the added advantage that the sensor network can be utilized for other ubiquitous computing applications. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Several techniques have recently been proposed to extract the features of an image. Feature extraction is one of the most important steps in various image processing and computer vision applications such as image retrieval, image classification, matching, object recognition. Relevant feature (global or local) contains discriminating information and is able to distinguish one object from others. Global features describe the entire image, whereas local features describe the image patches (small group of pixels). In this paper, we present a novel descriptor to extract the color-texture features via two information types. Our descriptor named concatenation of local and global color features is based on the fusion of global features using wavelet transform and a modified version of local ternary pattern, whereas, for the local features, speeded-up robust feature descriptor and bag of words model were used. All the features are extracted from the three color planes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our descriptor for image classification, we carried out experiments using the challenging datasets: New-BarkTex, Outex-TC13, Outex-TC14, MIT scene, UIUC sports event, Caltech 101 and MIT indoor scene. Experimental results showed that our descriptor outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. {\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature},

This study focuses on a type of indoor positioning systems called location fingerprinting technique that utilizes received signal strength indication (RSSI) of wireless local area network (WLAN) interfaces. Thus far, many characteristics of RSSI have not been thoroughly investigated. Many researchers have relied on the RSSI as sensor information to determine objects location while ignoring the characteristic of RSSI. Therefore, this paper looks into underlying mechanism of RSSI from the indoor positioning systems perspective. In particular, the distributions of RSSI from five different IEEE 802.11b/g WLAN interfaces are investigated using extensive measurement experiments. Desired properties of WLAN interfaces for location fingerprinting are also identified based on the measurement results. The ultimate goal is to use additional knowledge gained here to improve positioning performance and to model location fingerprinting based indoor positioning systems.},

We propose a novel image matching algorithm, named Re-Search, that is designed to cope with selfrepetitive structures and confusing patterns in the indoor environment. This algorithm uses state-of-art image search techniques, and it matches a query image with a two-pass strategy. In the first pass, a conventional image search algorithm is used to search for a small number of images that are most similar to the query image. In the second pass, the retrieval results from the first step are used to discover features that are more distinctive in the local context. We demonstrate and evaluate the Re-Search algorithm in the context of indoor localization, with the illustration of potential applications in object pop-out and data-driven zoom-in. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Sophisticated indoor design and growing development in urban architecture make indoor spaces more complex. And the indoor spaces are easily connected to public transportations such as subway and train stations. These phenomena allow to transfer outdoor activities to the indoor spaces. Constant development of technology has a significant impact on people knowledge about services such as location awareness services in the indoor spaces. Thus, it is required to develop the low-cost system to create the 3D model of the indoor spaces for services based on the indoor models. In this paper, we thus introduce the rotating stereo frame camera system that has two cameras and generate the indoor 3D model using the system. First, select a test site and acquired images eight times during one day with different positions and heights of the system. Measurements were complemented by object control points obtained from a total station. As the data were obtained from the different positions and heights of the system, it was possible to make various combinations of data and choose several suitable combinations for input data. Next, we generated the 3D model of the test site using commercial software with previously chosen input data. The last part of the processes will be to evaluate the accuracy of the generated indoor model from selected input data. In summary, this paper introduces the low-cost system to acquire indoor spatial data and generate the 3D model using images acquired by the system. Through this experiments, we ensure that the introduced system is suitable for generating indoor spatial information. The proposed low-cost system will be applied to indoor services based on the indoor spatial information.},

Gait refers to a particular way or manner of walking on feet. People can be monitored and identified at a distance without knowledge to subject. This paper gait recognition system, which is insensitive to view, clothing and lightning conditions. In the proposed work, an infrared camera is used to capture videos of moving objects. After that background subtraction is performed i.e. foreground objects (moving objects) like human, vehicles and animals are extracted by estimating background information. This is achieved using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) followed by morphological median filtering operation to remove noise in the background subtracted image. A classification metric is used to separate human being from other foreground objects. Shape and boundary information is used in the moving target classification. Subsequently, width vector of the outer contour of binary silhouette and the MPEG-7 Angular Radial Transform coefficients are taken as the feature vector. Binary silhouette obtained is used to produce gait features of a person. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) applied to reduce dimensionality of the features vectors. These feature vectors used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) for recognition of some individual. Length of gait cycle, maximum feet and hands distance, contour height, center of mass and color are taken as key feature. Proposed approach is tested over a self created database of thirteen different people with different resolution conditions. In indoor environment an average recognition percentage upto 97.73{\%} and for outdoor conditions recognition is upto 86.28{\%} (daylight) and 78.32{\%} recognition at night hours is observed.

The detected objects are stored with their spatio-temporal information in the robot's memory to be later used for generating the regions. The advantages of our method is that it is autonomous, requires only a small set of perceptual data and does not even require people to be present while generating the regions. The generated regions are validated using a 1-month dataset collected in an indoor office environment.

abstract = {Modern instruments like laser scanner and 3D cameras or image based techniques like structure from motion produce huge point clouds as base for further object analysis. This has considerably changed the way of data compilation away from selective manually guided processes towards automatic and computer supported strategies. However it's still a long way to achieve the quality and robustness of manual processes as data sets are mostly very complex. Looking at existing strategies 3D data processing for object detections and reconstruction rely heavily on either data driven or model driven approaches. These approaches come with their limitation on depending highly on the nature of data and inability to handle any deviation. Furthermore, the lack of capabilities to integrate other data or information in between the processing steps further exposes their limitations. This restricts the approaches to be executed with strict predefined strategy and does not allow deviations when and if new unexpected situations arise. We propose a solution that induces intelligence in the processing activities through the usage of semantics. The solution binds the objects along with other related knowledge domains to the numerical processing to facilitate the detection of geometries and then uses experts' inference rules to annotate them. The solution was tested within the prototypical application of the research project 'Wissensbasierte Detektion von Objekten in Punktwolken f{\"{u}}r Anwendungen im Ingenieurbereich (WiDOP)'. The flexibility of the solution is demonstrated through two entirely different USE Case scenarios: Deutsche Bahn (German Railway System) for the outdoor scenarios and Fraport (Frankfort Airport) for the indoor scenarios. Apart from the difference in their environments, they provide different conditions, which the solution needs to consider. While locations of the objects in Fraport were previously known, that of DB were not known at the beginning. {\textcopyright} 2015 SPIE.},

abstract = {Free-space optical transmission provides large bandwidth, small size, lightweight, low cost and good security. Diffuse infrared link configuration is also rather robust against shadowing. Its disadvantages are, however, bandwidth degradation due to multipath dispersion, sensitivity to ambient light and limited transmission distance due to the limitations of optical power budget. To specify the bandwidth and power budget requirements of the diffuse link, we performed ray-trace simulations for different room geometries and dimensions, and different transmitter and receiver locations. We considered both diffuse and specular reflections as well as shadowing and reflection effects due to blocking objects, such as furniture. The simulations were verified by analytically calculating the impulse response in simple diffuse reflection geometry. We also analyzed stray light induced shot noise effects. Furthermore, we simulated some properties of a quasi-diffuse link comprising of multi-beam transmitters with restricted beam divergences as well as detectors with narrow fields of view. Based on the study, novel Monte Carlo ray-tracing software packages, such as ASAP, can be used for diffuse link multipath dispersion and optical power path loss analysis. Ray tracing can also be used for parallel channel crosstalk and stray light analysis. Potential applications for these systems are high-bit-rate wireless LANs and free-space optical interconnects.},

In recently years, technologies have been developed that allow a device to recognize its environments using sensor data are developed. However, in an indoor environment, there are objects that affect sensor data. Therefore, sensors required either calibration to adjust their behavior, or clarification of the cause of incorrect behavior. This requires large amounts of sensor data to be collected indoors, but it is difficult for humans to collect this data in the indoor environment. Methods of data collection by humans are limited by the number of observation points that can reasonably be attained. In this paper, we proposed the FineMesh method for dense sampling using an autonomous robot. Our proposed method aims to increase the number of observation points. We constructed an autonomous robot that collects signals at 10 cm intervals using positioning estimates with camera images. To confirm the effect of collecting signals in more detail, we evaluate the accuracy of a Wi-Fi indoor positioning system constructed by our robot. We then use our platform to evaluate the efficacy of detailed signal collection. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {One of the primary requirements for future ubiquitous environment is to exploit location information to provide contextual services. Typical indoor location systems are heavily infra-structured making it difficult to deploy practically in home settings. In this article we propose a lightweight location model utilizing existing physical objects in our environment. Our approach is to use sensor augmented daily life objects surrounding us for extracting location information. Some of these everyday objects are static in nature and have designated location, like a bed in the bedroom, a refrigerator in the kitchen, etc. Utilizing this characteristics, we present "Spreha", a light weight hierarchical location model where static physical objects are used as reference points for identifying mobile objects like a chair, a watch, a lamp, etc. The model is organized in a tree structure representing the containment relationship and is independent of underlying sensing infrastructure. A prototype implementation of the model has been constructed as a pluggable module of a generic middleware using Bluetooth technology. This paper discusses about the design, architecture and findings of the prototype implementation. The implication of such lightweight location model is very important in realizing future environments where ubiquitous services will merge with grid services.},

abstract = {We introduce Harmonium, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors. Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates. Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive, lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or tag, fixed infrastructure anchors with known locations, and centralized processing that calculates the tag's position. Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that rejects narrowband interferers and extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of traditional ultra-wideband approaches. In a complex indoor environment, 90{\%} of position estimates obtained with Harmonium exhibit less than 31 cm of error with an average 9 cm of inter-sample noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90{\%} of position error is less than 42 cm. The tag draws 75 mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9 mJ per location fix at the 19 Hz update rate. Tags weigh 3 g and cost {\$}4.50 USD at modest volumes. Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors, devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture systems. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Furthermore, DR would provide reliable solutions in indoor/outdoor transitions, street canyons, and heavy tree canopies where GPS information is almost always inapplicable. Thus, DR is a desirable option for security and commercial applications that value position information. This paper describes and investigates how DR could provide accurate and reliable positioning using radio profile databases and map-matching.

abstract = {Localization, finding the coordinates of an object with respect to other objects with known coordinates - hereinafter, referred to as anchors, is a nonlinear problem, as it involves solving circle equations when relating distances to Cartesian coordinates, or, computing Cartesian coordinates from angles using the law of sines. This nonlinear problem has been a focus of significant attention over the past two centuries and the progress follows closely with the advances in instrumentation as well as applied mathematics, geometry, statistics, and signal processing. The Internet-of-Things (IoT), with massive deployment of wireless tagged things, has renewed the interest and activity in finding novel, expert, and accurate indoor self-localization methods, where a particular emphasis is on distributed approaches. This paper is dedicated to reviewing a notable alternative to the nonlinear localization problem, i.e., a linear-convex method, based on Khan et al.'s work. This linear solution utilizes relatively unknown geometric concepts in the context of localization problems, i.e., the barycentric coordinates and the Cayley-Menger determinants. Specifically, in an {\$}m{\$} -dimensional Euclidean space, a set of {\$}m+1{\$} anchors, objects with known locations, is sufficient (and necessary) to localize an arbitrary collection of objects with unknown locations - hereinafter, referred to as sensors, with a linear-iterative algorithm. To ease the presentation, we discuss the solution under a structural convexity condition, namely, the sensors lie inside the convex hull of at least {\$}m+1{\$} anchors. Although rigorous results are included, several remarks and discussion throughout this paper provide the intuition behind the solution and are primarily aimed toward researchers and practitioners interested in learning about this challenging field of research. Additional figures and demos have been added as auxiliary material to support this aim. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual design for tracking the location of a moving object within an indoor array of wireless transceivers passively, without the need for an electronic device or tag attached to the object. The conventional problem of signal attenuation due to object blocking, or shadowing prevalent in a typical wireless communication system is exploited to track an object. This is based on the principle of signal attenuation resulting from the object blocking the line-of-sight (LOS) link in a transceiver set. In particular, Wi-Fi transceivers operating at a frequency of 2.4 GHz (IEEE 802.11g standard) have been investigated. The estimated location is approximated using the measured received signal strength (RSS) and the relative distances between the transmitters and a receiver. Experimental results within a 3 m × 5 m area show that it is possible to track a human being using the proposed configuration. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Device-free localization (DFL) technology exploits target-induced fading over machine-type wireless links for passive object localization and tracking. In most cases, single frequency measurements are employed for DFL systems. However, machine-type communication protocols often employ slotted or time-division hopping policies over multiple channels, i.e. frequencies. In this paper, we propose a DFL system designed to extract and track the locations of the targets that are hidden into multi-frequency received signal strength (RSS) measurements. Due to strong multipath phenomena and in-band interferences, the use of some noisy channels might worsen the localization accuracy. A statistical model is thus proposed to relate RSS values obtained at various frequencies to the target location. Two different approaches based on optimal frequency selection and subspace decomposition are then proposed to identify the frequency measurements that maximize the localization accuracy. Experimental validation in an indoor multipath-limited environment reveals that the approach can improve the accuracy of both single and double target detection and localization with respect to the conventional single channel DFL approach. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

The system enable many applications such as locating a small piece of object or person in a room or buildings, implementing indoor navigation system and so forth. Our scheme uses small number of readers whereas the locations are set to yield minimal interference. Small number of readers lead to lower cost of the system, and lower interference means higher performance for our system in a practical usage. Our calculation is based on the power level of each reader.

The s-map represents the locations of obstacles in a planar domain, where obstacles are defined as any objects that can block movement of the robot. In building the s-map, the viewing triangle constraint and the stability constraint are introduced for efficient verification of vertical surfaces. These verified vertical surfaces and 3-D segments of obstacles smaller than a robot, are mapped to the s-map by simply dropping height information. Thus, the s-map is made directly form 3-D segments with simple verification, and represents obstacles in a planar domain so that it becomes a navigable map for the robot without further processing. In addition to efficient map building, the s-map represents the environment more realistically and completely. Furthermore, the s-map converts many navigation problems in 3-D, such as map fusion and path planning, into 2-D ones. We present the analysis of the s-map in terms of complexity and reliability, and discuss its pros and cons. Moreover, we show the results of the s-maps for indoor environments.},

In this work we fuse multi-modal sensory information to overcome the limitations of purely visual reconstruction for reconstruction of complex scenes including transparent and mirror surfaces. A full scene is captured by 360°C cameras and acoustic room impulse responses (RIRs) recorded by a loudspeaker and compact microphone array. Depth information of the scene is recovered by stereo matching from the captured images and estimation of major acoustic reflector locations from the sound. The coordinate systems for audio-visual sensors are aligned into a unified reference frame and plane elements are reconstructed from audio-visual data. Finally cuboid proxies are fitted to the planes to generate a complete room model.

Object models based on color histograms are further subdivided to differentiate similar color regions. Another tracking technique utilizes automatic detection by background subtraction and matches labels by comparing previous tracking results and detected object locations. The developed tracking algorithm more robustly recovers from tracking failure cases such as missing objects or overlapping objects than histogram based tracking. To cover large areas of interest, multiple camera images are integrated using homography based transformation. Based on tracking results in the integrated coordinate system, panning-Tilting-zooming (PTZ) cameras are incorporated to acquire multi-Angle videos of the tracking object. The feasibility of the proposed tracking based multi-Angle video acquisition is demonstrated through real indoor sport game scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Industrial, logistic, and several other applications require the discovery, localization, and tracking of objects using existing passive radio frequency identification (RFID) based sys-tems. We have analysed system concepts, methods, and protocols to enhance accuracy and coverage of RFID localization systems in order to find a moving transponder in an area with high precision over time using reading parameters and also to estimate the location of the transponder with low error rate if the reading information is not available. This research is also focusing on the infrastructure requirements of determining or recovering the location or path of the tag. The extension of the RFID localization beyond the area covered by the RFID reader system could be a solution. This can be carried out by using a special device called "Nodding antenna" or by supplying the transponders and antennas with the information on how to determine or store their respective positions. Advantages and application areas of the Location-on-Tag (LoT) concept and a novel localization method based on intelligent antennas that can enhance reliability and robustness of indoor RFID localization systems and ensure inter-building tag path tracking are introduced in this paper.},

It is currently being carried out within a so-called research group supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) in cooperation between the Institute for Photogrammetry, the Institute of Parallel and Distributed High-Performance Systems and the Institute of Communication Networks and Computer Engineering of the University of Stuttgart. A major task of the platform is the providing of a positioning service in outdoor and indoor locations. Additionally a communication environment must be defined to facilitate an exchange between the external information sources and virtual objects. The spatially aware applications are available for the user on small handheld devices like PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants). These computers arc equipped with sensors for positioning and mobile communication. In this way, die application is aware of the users' position within the spatial models. Users are "location aware'" and can receive spatial data from distributed servers. In order to support them on their way, several functionalities have to be provided: users have to be able to navigate and to perform queries on their environment, thus an interface to GIS has to be implemented. {\textcopyright} 2000 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

abstract = {The need for robust indoor localisation for all types of entities has been under continuous research by the ubiquitous community. Intelligent environments have to be supported with contextual information in order to facilitate intelligent behaviour. These contextual information include the location of humans and objects within the particular environment. Intelligent environments can be living areas with home automation, smart industrial plants, sensor-equipped office areas and indoor-emergency applications. So far technical solutions are either quite expensive or lack of precision for robust usage as components in intelligent service federations. We present rather low-cost localisation systems with great scalability based on active and passive RFID technology to locate humans, mobile service robots and objects of the daily use. The trade-off between technical effort and costs on the one hand and sufficient data accuracy for the application on the other hand is discussed. A motivation of our scenario, the technical concept and solution as well as the implementation and the integration that so far have been performed will be presented. Current prototypes of the proposed system are already being tested in a project aiming on development of smart assisted living environments. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {3D laser scanners are favoured sensors for mapping in mobile service robotics at indoor and outdoor applications, since they deliver precise measurements at a wide scanning range. The resulting maps are detailed since they have a high resolution. Based on these maps robots navigate through rough terrain, fulfil advanced manipulation, and inspection tasks. In case of specular reflective and transparent objects, e.g., mirrors, windows, shiny metals, the laser measurements get corrupted. Based on the type of object and the incident angle of the incoming laser beam there are three results possible: a measurement point on the object plane, a measurement behind the object plane, and a measurement of a reflected object. It is important to detect such situations to be able to handle these corrupted points. This paper describes why it is difficult to distinguish between specular reflective and transparent surfaces. It presents a 3D-Reflection-Pre-Filter Approach to identify specular reflective and transparent objects in point clouds of a multi-echo laser scanner. Furthermore, it filters point clouds from influences of such objects and extract the object properties for further investigations. Based on an Iterative-Closest-Point-algorithm reflective objects are identified. Object surfaces and points behind surfaces are masked according to their location. Finally, the processed point cloud is forwarded to a mapping module. Furthermore, the object surface corners and the type of the surface is broadcasted. Four experiments demonstrate the usability of the 3D-Reflection-Pre-Filter. The first experiment was made in a empty room containing a mirror, the second experiment was made in a stairway containing a glass door, the third experiment was made in a empty room containing two mirrors, the fourth experiment was made in an office room containing a mirror. This paper demonstrate that for single scans the detection of specular reflective and transparent objects in 3D is possible. It is more reliable in 3D as in 2D. Nevertheless, collect the data of multiple scans and post-filter them as soon as the object was bypassed should pursued. This is why future work concentrates on implementing a post-filter module. Besides, it is the aim to improve the discrimination between specular reflective and transparent objects.},

abstract = {Building occupants represent a rich source of information for evaluating environmental design practices and building operations. This article presents a scalable diagnostic technology for collecting real-time indoor environmental quality (IEQ) feedback from building occupants: an interactive desktop polling station. The device demonstrates the potential of ubiquitous computing, a model of human-computer interaction in which information processing is integrated into everyday objects, to engage occupants in providing IEQ feedback in real work environments. Example data from a field study of a high-performance office building are presented demonstrating the applicability of multiple devices to acquire detailed feedback over daily and seasonal variations in climatic conditions. Sample results show how polling station data can help identify the frequency and magnitude of discomfort with the spatial and temporal granularity needed to assess, validate, and improve the performance of environmentally responsive building technologies, controls, and design strategies. Analysis of repeated-measures subjective assessments paired with concurrent physical measurements is performed to demonstrate how existing standards and assumptions for occupant comfort could be evaluated and refined using detailed occupant feedback from buildings in use. Results are discussed regarding implications for improving decision-making for the design, certification, and operation of environmentally responsive buildings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) have recently received considerable attention, mainly because GPS is unavailable in indoor spaces and consumes considerable energy. On the other hand, predominant Smartphone OS localization subsystems currently rely on server-side localization processes, allowing the service provider to know the location of a user at all times. In this paper, we propose an innovative algorithm for protecting users from location tracking by the localization service, without hindering the provisioning of fine-grained location updates on a continuous basis. Our proposed Temporal Vector Map (TVM) algorithm, allows a user to accurately localize by exploiting a k-Anonymity Bloom (kAB) filter and a bestNeighbors generator of camouflaged localization requests, both of which are shown to be resilient to a variety of privacy attacks. We have evaluated our framework using a real prototype developed in Android and Hadoop HBase as well as realistic Wi-Fi traces scaling-up to several GBs. Our analytical evaluation and experimental study reveal that TVM is not vulnerable to attacks that traditionally compromise k-anonymity protection and indicate that TVM can offer fine-grained localization in approximately four orders of magnitude less energy and number of messages than competitive approaches.},

Based on the detection of local features, and their location constraints several object regions are hypothesized in an input image.

abstract = {The localization capability of a mobile robot is central to basic navigation and map building tasks. We describe a probabilistic environment model which facilitates global localization scheme by means of location recognition. In the exploration stage the environment is partitioned into locations, each characterized by a set of scale-invariant keypoints. The descriptors associated with these keypoints can be robustly matched despite changes in contrast, scale and viewpoint. We demonstrate the efficacy of these features for location recognition, where given a new view the most likely location from which this view came from is determined. The misclassifications due to dynamic changes in the environment or inherent appearance ambiguities are overcome by exploiting location neighborhood relationships captured by a Hidden Markov Model. We report the recognition performance of this approach in an indoor environment consisting of eighteen locations and discuss the suitability of this approach for a more general class of recognition problems. Once the most likely location has been determined we demonstrate how to robustly compute the relative pose between the representative view and the current view. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In object recognition, Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) has been the most popular framework to incorporate spatial information into the bag-of-words model. Dividing each layer of the pyramid into 2l×2l spatial windows, SPM extracts histograms from each and concatenate them to create image representation. SPM offers an approximate spatial arrangement to the previously unordered collection of codeword histogram. This paper presents a detailed investigation on the optimality of the traditional SPM model and simultaneously offers a framework to obtain the most optimal spatial window arrangement from the set of possible spatial windows. Using such model, we are able to consistently achieve significant increase in recognition performance, up to 4.38{\%}. With nearly 40{\%} less memory cost, it shows that the traditional spatial window arrangement of SPM is indeed inefficient. We tested our proposed model using 15 Scene, Caltech 101, Caltech 256, MIT-Indoor, UIUC-Sport, and STL-10. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a scale-independent (space and time) tracking framework for moving entities (objects, animals, humans). The framework allows for the integration, processing and visualization of spatio-temporal data obtained from heterogeneous sensor sources. The framework does not rely upon one tracking and localization technology for the data collection, but instead considers the combination of several technologies to obtain and calculate the best positioning result. Not only are typical localization and tracking technologies considered as data providers, but also keystroke sensors, like touch screens with a fixed location in the tracking environment. Different sizes and characteristics of moving entities are considered as well as different tracking environments or use cases in different domains. A prototypical implementation of basic functionalities processes the spatio-temporal data in a core and provides it by different internal and external interfaces. The modular framework consists of different usage modules. A visualization module is implemented as a first module for the framework. Thus the display of an existing three-dimensional environmental model with the sensors and the visualization of the tracked entities are possible. Furthermore, sensors can be added, changed and managed in the three-dimensional scene. The development of further modules for data analysis for different use cases allows for the analysis of large amounts of data, for example with machine learning techniques. Two different use cases (laboratory mice and service technicians) were used to develop and apply the framework.},

abstract = {In this paper, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based classifier employed in a tree structure is presented to recognize the human actions in a wide and complex environment. In particular, the proposed classifier is based on a supervised learning process and achieves the required classification in a multi-step process. This multi-step process is performed simply by adopting a tree structured which is built during the training phase. Hence, there is no need of any priori information like in other classifiers such as the number of hidden neurons or hidden layers in a multilayer neural network based classifier or an exhaustive search as used in training algorithms for decision trees. A skeleton based strategy is adopted to extract the features from a given video sequence representing any human action. A Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera is used to monitor the wide and complex test environment. A background mosaic image is built offline and used to compute the background images in real time. A background subtraction strategy has been adopted for detecting the object in various frames and to extract their corresponding silhouette. A skeleton based process is used to extract attributes of a feature vector corresponding to a human action. Finally, the proposed framework is tested on various indoor and outdoor scenarios and encouraging results are achieved in terms of classification accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2011 SPIE-IS{\&}T.},

abstract = {An indoor localization technology is increasingly critical as location-aware applications evolve. Researchers have proposed several indoor localization technologies. Because most of the proposed indoor localization technologies simply involve using the received signal strength indicator value of radio-frequency identification (RFID) for indoor localization, radio-frequency interference, and environmental factors often limit the accuracy of localization results. Therefore, this study proposes an accurate RFID localization based on the neural network (ARL-N2), a passive RFID indoor localization scheme for identifying tag positions in a room, combining a location identification based on dynamic active RFID calibration algorithm with a backpropagation neural network (BPN). The proposed scheme composed of two phases: in the training phase, an appropriate BPN architecture is constructed using the training data derived from the coordinates of reference tags and the coordinates obtained using the localization algorithm. By contrast, the online phase involves calculating the tracking tag coordinates and using these values as BPN inputs, thereby enhancing the estimated location. A performance evaluation of the ARL-N2 schemes confirms its high localization accuracy. The proposed method can be used to locate critical objects in difficult-to-find areas by creating minimal errors and applying and economical technique.

abstract = {The Landmarc algorithm is the most common scheme to achieve the object location. However, Landmarc has been found with estimation errors due to the type of RSSI radio property. In the present study, we introduce an enhanced statistical approach in order to process RSSI data and estimate the tracking tag positions in a room. We proposed herein two location estimation scheme, namely, the ESL Average and ESL Median schemes. Both schemes periodically collect RSSI data within a fixed time period and calculate final data values to estimate location by using the Landmarc algorithm. For the ESL{\_}Average scheme, the final RSSI value is the average of all RSSI values measured in the given time period. The ESL Median scheme uses the median of RSSI values to estimate the tracking tag location. We also estimate the estimation accuracy of the two proposed schemes by experiment and comparison with the Landmarc algorithm. The result from performance evaluations reveals that the proposed schemes yield performed higher accuracy than the traditional Landmarc scheme. {\textcopyright} 2012 ICIC International.},

In this paper, PIR is used to compose the non-terminal indoor localization system mounted on the ceiling. The proposed PIR detection module (PDM) system consists of two PIR modules. The object space is divided into discrete cells by using appropriate reference structures. After analyzing collected infrared signal of human sensing, the target location can be estimated.

VRML, a powerful 3D modeling tool is used for designing 3D objects in indoor environments.

Moreover, a reliable RSSI smoothing algorithm had been proposed to cater the reflecting and attenuating of objects in surrounding environment for RSSI ranging.

abstract = {Recently, an indoor navigation has attracted great attention in industries and research institutes. Also, a wearable device such as smart glasses has been emerging as the next-generation device to substitute the smartphone. We have a plan to develop an indoor navigation system based on smart glasses as soon as it is released in Republic of Korea. One of the most critical problems in vision-based indoor navigation is difficulty in the database construction when estimating the locations of users. Here, we propose a vision-based navigation system in indoor environments which uses an indoor map and does not require an image database. In each image, features are extracted to recognize the indoor objects without using image database. We define the metric about the four features which are pillar detection metric (PDM), hallway entrance detection metric (HEDM), hallway detection metric (HDM), and absence. Since the four metrics are normalized in the range of 0 or 1, we can classify them using the decision tree. After the classification, we estimate the position of the user through the angle-based matching between the recognized objects and the objects in an indoor map. We already know the angular information of each image using magnetometer and gyroscope built in smartphone. So, we can know the angle between the current position and recognized object. The current position of user is represented as a linear equation and we can solve it using pseudo inverse. To verify the performance of the proposed system, we conducted the positioning experiments in indoor environment. The indoor map is comprised of hall and hallway and we captured the image in six positions which were four halls and two hallways. In each position, we captured 18 images around the user with its angular information. The experimental results show an average recognition rate with 71.3{\%} and the positioning performance with 7 meters. Copyright {\textcopyright} (2014) by the Institute of Navigation.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach for determining the location and orientation of a camera mounted on an autonomous vehicle. We choose road boundaries and objects with vertical edges, which can be found commonly in indoor and outdoor environments, to be the calibration objects. The camera models are derived by using two or three consecutive images under the assumption that the height of the camera and the distance during the photographing of images are known in advance. Since the direction of a line in 3D space is perpendicular to the normal of the plane formed by this line and the camera center, the tilt and swing angles can be computed from the first image. The pan angle can then be derived analytically by using the projections of vertical edges in three consecutive images. If the angle between the direction of movement of the autonomous vehicle and the direction of the road boundaries is large enough, then the variation of the projections of the road boundaries is apparent, and two images are sufficient to find the pan angle. If the moving direction is parallel to the direction of the road boundaries, only one image is needed to determine the pan angle. Finally, two translational parameters can be found analytically by employing the projections of vertical edges in two or three consecutive images.},

abstract = {A series of panoramic images are usually used to generate a 720° panorama image. Although panoramic images are typically used for establishing tour guiding systems, in this research, we demonstrate the potential of using panoramic images acquired from multiple sites to create not only 720° panorama, but also three-dimensional (3D) point clouds and 3D indoor models. Since 3D modeling is one of the goals of this research, the location of the panoramic sites needed to be carefully planned in order to maintain a robust result for close-range photogrammetry. After the images are acquired, panoramic images are processed into 720° panoramas, and these panoramas which can be used directly as panorama guiding systems or other applications. In addition to these straightforward applications, interior orientation parameters can also be estimated while generating 720° panorama. These parameters are focal length, principle point, and lens radial distortion. The panoramic images can then be processed with closerange photogrammetry procedures to extract the exterior orientation parameters and generate 3D point clouds. In this research, VisaulSFM, a structure from motion software is used to estimate the exterior orientation, and CMVS toolkit is used to generate 3D point clouds. Next, the 3D point clouds are used as references to create building interior models. In this research, Trimble Sketchup was used to build the model, and the 3D point cloud was added to the determining of locations of building objects using plane finding procedure. In the texturing process, the panorama images are used as the data source for creating model textures. This 3D indoor model was used as an Augmented Reality model replacing a guide map or a floor plan commonly used in an on-line touring guide system. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The 3D indoor model generating procedure has been utilized in two research projects: a cultural heritage site at Kinmen, and Taipei Main Station pedestrian zone guidance and navigation system. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of using panoramic images to generate 3D point clouds and 3D models. However, it is currently a manual and labor-intensive process. A research is being carried out to Increase the degree of automation of these procedures. {\textcopyright} 2015, Copernicus. All rights reserved.},

In particular, inertial sensor-based locating systems are often supplemented with radio signals to improve localization accuracy. A radio-assisted localization system is still costly due to the infrastructure requirements and management overheads. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and yet accurate indoor pedestrian localization scheme with a small number of radio beacons whose location information is unknown. Our scheme applies the Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) technique used in robotics to mobile device, which is equipped with both inertial sensors and the IEEE802.15.4a Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) radio, to obtain accurate locations of pedestrians in indoor environment. The proposed system is validated with real implementations.

abstract = {RFID-based location awareness is becoming the most important issue in many fields in recent years, such as ubiquitous computing, mobile computing. In indoor localization systems RSSI-based methods are usually used in office buildings. However, RSSI is susceptible to external influences, and performances unstably due to the environmental factors affecting signal propagation. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid localization method for tracking moving object using the two typical methods which are signal propagation model and fingerprinting. According to a threshold which is defined as an effective working distance of signal propagation model between target tag and RFID reader, we choose the different localization algorithm to estimate the location of moving object. The threshold is obtained by calculating the slop of signal attenuation curve. If the distance is within the effective reading range of RFID reader, we revise signal propagation model by maximum likelihood estimation and use it to calculate the object position by minimum cumulative error. Otherwise, the fingerprinting location method is used in the external area, and the particle filter is also used as the core algorithm. The experimental results show that our method not only reduces the computation complexity but also ensures the accuracy in large indoor area {\textcopyright} 2013 SERSC.},

Therefore, this paper divides the localization area into many sub-regions and constructs separately the signal path loss model of each sub-region. Then an improved LANDMARC method is proposed. Firstly, the deployment principle of RFID readers and tags is presented for constructing localization sub-region. Secondly, the virtual reference tags are introduced to create a virtual signal strength space with RFID readers and real reference tags in every sub-region. Lastly, k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used to locate the target object and an error compensating algorithm is proposed for correcting localization result. The results in real application show that the new method enhances the positioning accuracy to 18.2{\%} and reduces the time cost to 30{\%} of the original LANDMARC method without additional tags and readers. {\textcopyright} 2013 KSII.},

Existing RFID localization approaches rely on signal strength to measure the distance between RFID reader and tags. However, because of the environmental complexity and inferences, the measurement of distance by signal strength is not accurate, which causes large error in localization. In this paper we develop a novel algorithm to improve the RFID localization accuracy. Our algorithm is based on particle swarm optimization. More importantly, we add reference tags in the deployment, and design a parameter named Correction Factor in PSO to measure the distances more accurately by signal strength.

Previous research studies mainly focus on how to answer the snap-shot density queries over historical trajectories. However, the real applications usually tend to predict whether a region is a dense region. Especially in indoor environments, such predictive density queries are valuable for high-level analysis but face tremendous challenges. In this paper, by leveraging the Markov correlations, we effectively predict the future locations of moving objects and conduct the density queries accordingly. In particular, we present an optimized framework which contains three phases to tackle this problem. First, we design an index structure based on the transition matrix to facilitate the search process. Second, we propose the space and probability pruning techniques to improve the query efficiency significantly. Finally, we apply an accurate method and an approximate sampling method to verify whether each unpruned region is a dense region. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed solutions can outperform the baseline algorithm by up to 2 orders of magnitudes in running time. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland, All rights Reserved.},

Due to the location uncertainty of the objects to be searched, it is difficult to obtain the objects semantic and location information accurately and in real time at a long distance. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a vision-based real-time identification and location system that locates belonging objects by identification objects by simulating human's hierarchical perception of environment and combining location structure information between objects. Firstly, extracting ground in the scene by using the PCA and centroid coordinate, using the ground convex hull and improved region growth segmentation algorithm to achieve bottom-up clustering. Then the CVFH features are used to identify the identification objects in the identification database. After using the returned centroid to obtain the point cloud image for near distance, repeating the above steps to identify and locate the belonging objects in the child belonging database selected based on the identification belonging relationship. At last, experiment and analysis are carried out on the "Turtlebot" service robot platform to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2018, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

abstract = {Based on studying the basic law of the Chinese natural language representation of path (NLRP), a visual navigation algorithm based on constrained natural language for indoor environments is designed through establishing the imagery map for mobile robot navigation. Firstly, landmarks are extracted from constrained Chinese text, relative directions and distances among the landmarks are obtained, and then those landmarks are mapped onto the imagery map. Secondly, key boot points, by which the path is divided into several segments, are extracted to realize the path planning of the mobile robot. For each segment, the matching degree of SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Feature) feature points between the referenced object's real-time pictures and sample pictures in the database is calculated, and the data of odometer are fused to ascertain the approximate location of the mobile robot. Then, based on the approximate location obtained in the previous segment, the running direction in the next segment is calculated, and the robot will run along it. The calculation and movement go analogically till the last segment. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility, validity and robustness of the method.},

Using the UWB characteristics and the 3-tier organization (consisting of a large number of cost-effective tags, a small number of cheap and low-power hubs and a few synchronized base stations), the proposed localization scheme can provide a wide geographical coverage and precise positioning. Localization is based on the arrival time of the UWB pulses at the reference nodes with known locations. We formalize the hub placement problem as an optimization problem.

abstract = {Obtaining accurate location information of tracked objects is the cornerstone of providing high-quality location-based services (LBSs). Recently, passive localization has become an increasingly important research theme, attracting the attention from both academic and industrial communities. However, existing Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based passive localization methods mainly focus on the indoor localization problem and require Wi-Fi detection equipment to scan wireless communications simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the concept of indoor region localization, which aims at estimating the region where an object stayed for a given time interval. Moreover, a Bayesian probabilistic model is presented to cope with this issue. The key novelty of our method lies in that it allows Wi-Fi detection equipment to behave in an asynchronous fashion, which eliminates synchronization concerns when implementing the positioning system. Specifically, it first introduces a time window for each timestamp, and then aggregates all the sensing records in the given time window to obtain an RSSI measurement vector. Afterward, a kernel function is utilized to measure the conditional probability with respect to every fingerprint, and all these probabilities are combined to obtain the posterior probabilities corresponding to different regions. Extensive experiments are conducted on both public and proprietary data sets and our method significantly outperforms all the comparing algorithms in terms of each evaluation metric.},

abstract = {Cameras and surveillance systems are widely installed at streets, communities, schools, buildings and so on. In our previous results, the global positioning system (GPS) was incorporated with the visual tracking technique, called GPS-VT. A person can be located and tracking according his GPS coordinate in the outdoor environment. However, GPS-VT service is unavailable when the person walks in an indoor environment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a seamless fusion of GPS-VT service for persons from the outdoor to indoor environment. In order to achieve the above purpose, template matching, shadow removal, and collision resolution techniques are used for the tracking among multiple cameras in the indoor environment. Besides, the elapsed time of a person leaving the field-of-views (FOV) of one camera and entering the FOV of another is not a fixed value. An automatic estimation mechanism is designed and a normal distribution function is used to estimate an acceptable interval of the elapsed time. Such a mechanism is performed for any two successive cameras. Besides, a prototype was implemented to demonstrate that the GPS-VT service is extended from outdoor to indoor environment with multiple cameras. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Based on training data and polynomial curve fitting approach the proposed technique estimates the distance of the camera from the objects. For a real world object one can determine a fixed equation which can then be used to find any random distance. The approach is efficient and can effectively be applied to any indoor navigation or motion planning algorithm. Based on the estimated distances from different objects the proposed algorithm estimates the accurate location of the camera (mounted on a robot) in a room. For detection we have used template matching technique. Algorithm compares the reference template with the objects of interest in a cluttered environment by using SURF (speeded up robust features).

We solve the dynamic person search problem by uniquely considering evidence of household objects along with a user spatial-temporal model to increase the probability of finding the user. Our planner utilizes a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to plan optimal robot search paths in the environment as the user and evidence locations are partially observable. Extensive simulated experiments in a home environment were conducted to compare our proposed evidence-based search approach with 1) a search technique without prior user information, and 2) a search technique that only uses a user model. The results show that our proposed search technique has higher success rates for finding the user and is more robust to the dynamic behaviors of the user. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 ASME},

abstract = {A new methodology for 3D change detection which can support effective robot sensing and navigation in a reconstructed indoor environment is presented in this paper. We register the RGB-D images acquired with an untracked camera into a globally consistent and accurate point-cloud model. This paper introduces a robust system that detects camera position for multiple RGB video frames by using both photo-metric error and feature based method. It utilizes the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to establish geometric constraints between the point-cloud as they become aligned. For the change detection part, a bag-of-word (DBoW) model is used to match the current frame with the previous key frames based on RGB images with Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature. Then combine the key-frame translation and ICP to align the current point-cloud with reconstructed 3D scene to localize the robot position. Meanwhile, camera position and orientation are used to aid robot navigation. After preprocessing the data, we create an Octomap Model to detect the scene change measurements. The experimental evaluations performed to evaluate the capability of our algorithm show that the robot's location and orientation are accurately determined and provide promising results for change detection indicating all the object changes with very limited false alarm rate. {\textcopyright} 2017 SPIE.},

Due to features like contactless communications, high data rate, non-line-of-sight readability, compactness and low cost, passive Radio Frequency Identification technology is very attractive for indoor localization. Technologies and techniques can be employed in combination, aimed to improve accuracy and precision of localization by heterogeneous data fusion. Object recognition, moving object localization and tracking can be successfully implemented using integration of RFID technology and digital image processing techniques. The block matching algorithm based on region of interest can be efficiently used in image processing analysis for motion segmentation and object tracking. By using regions of interest we eliminate the influence of other large moving objects and avoid unnecessary computations. In this chapter, the improvement of RFID localization using motion segmentation applied on the region of interest extracted using RFID is described. The presented solution shows significant reduction of the position estimation error and variance in comparison to the conventional passive RFID position estimation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

abstract = {Camera networks are widely used for tasks such as surveillance, monitoring and tracking. In order to accomplish these tasks, knowledge of localization information such as camera locations and other geometric constraints about the environment (e.g. walls, rooms, and building layout) are typically considered to be essential. However, this information is not required for tasks such as estimating the topology of camera network coverage, or coordinate-free object tracking and navigation. In this paper, we propose a simplicial representation (called CN-Complex) that can be constructed from discrete local observations, and utilize this novel representation to recover topological information of the network coverage. We prove that our representation captures the correct topological information for coverage in 2.5D layouts, and demonstrate its utility in simulations as well as an experimental setup. Our proposed approach is particularly useful in the context of ad-hoc camera networks in indoor/outdoor urban environments with distributed but limited computational power and energy.

abstract = {This paper aims at tracking vehicles from monocular intensity image sequences and presents an efficient and robust approach to three-dimensional (3-D) model-based vehicle tracking. Under the weak perspective assumption and the ground-plane constraint, the movements of model projection in the two-dimensional image plane can be decomposed into two motions: translation and rotation. They are the results of the corresponding movements of 3-D translation on the ground plane (GP) and rotation around the normal of the GP, which can be determined separately. A new metric based on point-to-line segment distance is proposed to evaluate the similarity between an image region and an instantiation of a 3-D vehicle model under a given pose. Based on this, we provide an efficient pose refinement method to refine the vehicle's pose parameters. An improved EKF is also proposed to track and to predict vehicle motion with a precise kinematics model. Experimental results with both indoor and outdoor data show that the algorithm obtains desirable performance even under severe occlusion and clutter. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

A variety of services, e.g., location-based services and security control, are relevant to indoor spaces. Such services can be improved substantially if they are capable of utilizing indoor distances. However, existing indoor space models do not account well for indoor distances. To address this shortcoming, we propose a data management infrastructure that captures indoor distance and facilitates distance-aware query processing. In particular, we propose a distance-aware indoor space model that integrates indoor distance seamlessly. To enable the use of the model as a foundation for query processing, we develop accompanying, efficient algorithms that compute indoor distances for different indoor entities like doors as well as locations. We also propose an indexing framework that accommodates indoor distances that are pre-computed using the proposed algorithms. On top of this foundation, we develop efficient algorithms for typical indoor, distance-aware queries. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of the proposals. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Indoor tracking data is being amassed due to the deployment of indoor positioning technologies. Analysing such data discloses useful insights that are otherwise hard to obtain. For example, by studying tracking data from an airport, we can identify the shops and restaurants that are most popular among passengers. In this paper, we study two query types for finding frequently visited Points of Interest (POIs) from symbolic indoor tracking data. The snapshot query finds those POIs that were most frequently visited at a given time point, whereas the interval query finds such POIs for a given time interval. A typical example of symbolic tracking is RFID-based tracking, where an object with an RFID tag is detected by an RFID reader when the object is in the reader's detection range. A symbolic indoor tracking system deploys a limited number of proximity detection devices, like RFID readers, at preselected locations, covering only part of the host indoor space. Consequently, symbolic tracking data is inherently uncertain and only enables the discrete capture of the trajectories of indoor moving objects in terms of coarse regions. We provide uncertainty analyses of the data in relation to the two kinds of queries. The outcomes of the analyses enable us to design processing algorithms for both query types. An experimental evaluation with both real and synthetic data suggests that the framework and algorithms enable efficient and scalable query processing. {\textcopyright} 2016, Copyright is with the authors.},

abstract = {Indoor location systems can track objects using near-field electromagnetic ranging technology (NFER). However, the ranging error can be large because the phase difference between the electronic and magnetic fields cannot be measured directly. This study proposes a method that adopts an adaptive time-delay estimation algorithm based on a normalized maximum correntropy criterion (NMCC-ATDE) instead of exploiting the phase behavior of the electromagnetic signal for near-field ranging. In the NMCC-ATDE algorithm, the input signal is normalized to mitigate any sudden increase in the input signal. As our simulation results reveal, compared to the algorithms based on maximum correntropy criterion and normalized least mean square, the NMCC-ATDE algorithm can estimate the time delay in real time with a fast convergence rate and small steady-state error. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {We address the problem of fusing laser ranging data from multiple mobile robots that are surveying an area as part of a robot search and rescue or area surveillance mission. We are specifically interested in the case where members of the robot team are working in close proximity to each other. The advantage of this teamwork is that it greatly speeds up the surveying process; the area can be quickly covered even when the robots use a random motion exploration approach. However, the disadvantage of the close proximity is that it is possible, and even likely, that the laser ranging data from one robot include many depth readings caused by another robot. We refer to this as mutual interference. Using a team of two Pioneer 3-AT robots with tilted SICK LMS-200 laser sensors, we evaluate several techniques for fusing the laser ranging information so as to eliminate the mutual interference. There is an extensive literature on the mapping and localization aspect of this problem. Recent work on mapping has begun to address dynamic or transient objects. Our problem differs from the dynamic map problem in that we look at one kind of transient map feature, other robots, and we know that we wish to completely eliminate the feature. We present and evaluate three different approaches to the map fusion problem: Aa robot-centric approach, based on estimating team member locations; a map-centric approach, based on inspecting local regions of the map, and a combination of both approaches. We show results for these approaches for several experiments for a two robot team operating in a confined indoor environment . {\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

In this research work, we present experimental results when performing indoor positioning in a dynamic environment when using channel frequency response as the indoor location's fingerprint. Dynamic environments introduce varying channel frequency responses for a given indoor location, which makes it difficult to locate desired indoor objects. According to our experiments, we find that indoor fingerprints become uncorrelated within a 15-min window. To bridge the gap between daily fingerprints, we propose three quick remedies in updating the Channel Frequency Response (CFR) database. These updates allow indoor localization even in the presence of dynamic environmental changes (e.g., people movement, interference of other wireless signals, etc.) and are able to 100{\%} localize indoor locations separated by at least five (5) centimeters. We highlight that in the experiments, there is only one anchor node used to estimate the desired indoor location.},

abstract = {3D scene modeling for indoor environments has stirred significant interest in the last few years. The obtained photo-realistic rendering of internal structures are being used in a huge variety of civilian and military applications such as training, simulation, patrimonies conservation, localization and mapping. Whereas, building such complicated maps poses significant challenges for both computer vision and robotic communities (low lighting and textureless structures, transparent and specular surfaces, registration and fusion problems, coverage of all details, real time constraint, etc.). Recently, the Microsoft Kinect sensors, originally developed as a gaming interface, have received a great deal of attention as being able to produce high quality depth maps in real time. However, we realized that these active sensors failed completely on transparent and specular surfaces due to many technical causes. As these objects should be involved into the 3D model, we have investigated methods to inspect them without any modification of the hardware. In particular, the Structure from Motion (SFM) passive technique can be efficiently integrated to the reconstruction process to improve the detection of these surfaces. In fact, we proposed to fill the holes in the depth map provided by the Infrared (IR) kinect sensor with new values passively retrieved by the SFM technique. This helps to acquire additional huge amount of depth information in a relative short time from two consecutive RGB frames. To conserve the real time aspect of our approach we propose to select key-RGB-images instead of using all the available frames. The experiments show a strong improvement in the indoor reconstruction as well as transparent object inspection.},

abstract = {Outlier elimination is a crucial stage in keypoints-based methods, especially in extreme conditions. In this chapter, a fast and robust “Core” Structural Verification Algorithm (CSVA) for a variety of applications and feature extraction methods is developed. The proposed algorithm pipeline involves many-to-one matches' exclusion, the improved Hough clustering of keypoint matches, and cluster verification procedure. The Hough clustering is improved through an accurate incorporation of translation parameters of similarity transform and “partially ignoring” the boundary impact using two displaced accumulators. The cluster verification procedure involves the use of modified RANSAC. It is also shown that the use of the nearest neighbour ratio may eliminate too many inliers, when two images are matched (especially in extreme conditions), and the preferable method is a simple many-to-one matches exclusion. The theory and experiment prove the propriety of the suggested parameters, algorithms, and modifications. The developed cluster analysis algorithms are robust and computationally efficient at the same time. These algorithms use some specific information (rigidity of objects in a scene), consume low volume memory and only 3 ms in average on a standard Intel i7 processor for verification of 1,000 matches (i.e. magnitudes less than the time needed to generate those matches). The CSVA has been successfully applied to practical tasks with minor adaptation, such as the matching of 3D indoor scenes, retrieval of images of 3D scenes based on the concept of Bag of Words (BoWs), and matching of aerial and cosmic photographs with strong appearance changes caused by season, day-time, and viewpoint variation. Eliminating a huge number of outliers using geometrical constraints allowed to reach the reliability and accuracy in all solutions. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract = {New-generation computational software is the emerging and enabling technology that is revolutionizing the delivery of education and the analysis of results to yield information. This allows for the dynamic and interactive analytical processing of both archival and current experimental data. The design and usability of a database-driven computational system that demonstrates the qualitative analysis of the dynamic balance of thermoregulatory processes is discussed. Incorporated within the software are educational modules that describe the effect of exercise on body temperature and heart rate, the effects of the environment on body temperature, methods of prevention of heat illness and first-aid procedures to be utilized in the event of a medical emergency. These modules are linked to clinical and experimental research databases. A user-friendly interface allows both non-technical users and scientists to retrieve information of interest easily. Simple examples are presented which demonstrate the utility of the interface. These include normal (indoor) body temperature, body temperature while hiking in a mountainous region and partial results from a study that characterized the skin temperature and heart rate response during bicycle ergometry. Temperature was measured by thermistors from 13 body segments. The data was collected and compiled into a relational database. Several algorithms, some of which utilize artificial intelligence objects incorporated within the database, analyze the data and yield results based on user preferences.},

abstract = {One of the challenging problems for indoor wireless multifloor positioning systems is the presence of reference node (RN) failures, which cause the values of received signal strength (RSS) to be missed during the online positioning phase of the location fingerprinting technique. This leads to performance degradation in terms of floor accuracy, which in turn affects other localization procedures. This paper presents a robust floor determination algorithm called Robust Mean of Sum-RSS (RMoS), which can accurately determine the floor on which mobile objects are located and can work under either the fault-free scenario or the RN-failure scenarios. The proposed fault tolerance floor algorithm is based on the mean of the summation of the strongest RSSs obtained from the IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) during the online phase. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with those of different floor determination algorithms in literature. The experimental results show that the proposed robust floor determination algorithm outperformed the other floor algorithms and can achieve the highest percentage of floor determination accuracy in all scenarios tested. Specifically, the proposed algorithm can achieve greater than 95{\%} correct floor determination under the scenario in which 40{\%} of RNs failed. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 Kriangkrai Maneerat et al.},

abstract = {Most existing wireless indoor positioning systems have only success performance requirements in normal operating situations whereby all wireless equipment works properly. There remains a lack of system reliability that can support emergency situations when there are some reference node failures, such as in earthquake and fire scenarios. Additionally, most systems do not incorporate environmental information such as temperature and relative humidity level into the process of determining the location of objects inside the building. To address these gaps, we propose a novel integrated framework for wireless indoor positioning systems based on a location fingerprinting technique which is called the Robust and low Complexity indoor positioning systems framework (RoC framework). Our proposed integrated framework consists of two essential indoor positioning processes: The system design process and the localization process. The RoC framework aims to achieve robustness in the system design structure and reliability of the target location during the online estimation phase either under a normal situation or when some reference nodes (RNs) have failed. The availability of low-cost temperature and relative humidity sensors can provide additional information for the location fingerprinting technique and thereby reduce location estimation complexity by including this additional information. Experimental results and comparative performance evaluation revealed that the RoC framework can achieve robustness in terms of the system design structure, whereby it was able to provide the highest positioning performance in either fault-free or RN-failure scenarios. Moreover, in the online estimation phase, the proposed framework can provide the highest reliability of the target location under the RN-failure scenarios and also yields the lowest computational complexity in online searching compared to other techniques. Specifically, when compared to the traditional weighted k-nearest neighbor techniques (WKNN) under the 30{\%} RN-failure scenario at Building B, the proposed RoC framework shows 74.1{\%} better accuracy performance and yields 55.1{\%} lower computational time than the WKNN. {\textcopyright} 2019 Kriangkrai Maneerat and Kamol Kaemarungsi.},

abstract = {Location-aware personal computing application can work accurately by estimating user location using IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) signals in indoor environment. Nowadays, Wi-Fi is more and more widely available and installed on most mobile devices. Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi's signal fluctuates greatly up to 33{\%}, some of the causes are reflection, refraction, temperature, humidity, the dynamic environment. These make user location not in good accuracy to be estimated. In this paper we propose the use of Particle Filter to improve user location estimation which involves the modeling of non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. To make the estimation accurate, the real time data of multi-observer Wi-Fi signals is used. The loss of diversity and parameter chosen in order to reduce the ambiguity is observed in tracking user location. We improve the Particle Filter Algorithm by giving target/reference points and by reducing the computational complexity. This paper shows that the estimation of the location from real-time data is close to the real tracking object. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Amongst various application usages of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology, Indoor localization or positioning has gained much importance and value over the past few years. Different algorithms and hardware have been developed with active research still in place. Research towards localization of objects and personnel specifically using passive RFID technology has immensely reduced the overall solution cost, while effectively increasing positioning accuracy. In this paper, we present a passive RFID-based indoor localization algorithm for the Buildings and Constructions Industry. In complex building designs, such as multi-storey car parks or high-rise hospitals, it is often required to locate a particular car or medical personnel at least at a room level accuracy in case of emergencies. In the methodology presented, passive RFID tags with unknown locations are tracked and identified using a number of similar tags with known positions. This approach offers the advantage to have less number of expensive RFID readers to locate unknown tags. Instead, low cost passive RFID tags collaborate together to find the unknown tags' locations. The distance and positions of the known tags along with mathematical techniques and computations form the basis of our algorithm to compute the final position of unknown tags. The experimental results are acquired by considering a simulated implementation in a 10m×10m room using two UHF RFID readers. A number of simulation results show an average linear error in positioning of 1.32m from reader 1 and that of 3.14m from reader 2. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Architecture and Acoustic are intimately related, been sound an extremely important part of the human natural environment. Sounds give specific qualities to spaces establishing whether or not a hearing condition is pleasant or annoying to those who inhabit them, and may or may not favor oral communication, a fundamental activity in human interaction. A pleasant sound may improve human wellbeing, while a noise can be a great obstacle to a person's comfort, creating discomfort, concentration issues and health problems. The role of architecture is clear, since the form and materiality of a space, change its acoustic conditions. The use of space and the activity to be developed, as such, determine the acoustic requirements. Within these, clarity of message delivered is critical in an indoor environment and it's evaluated through a parameter called intelligibility. The overall object of this paper is to determine whether or not the intelligibility of a space is modify by the way it is occupied. For the case study, an environment with high demands on intelligibility was selected: a preschool classroom with children age 3 to 5 years old, where acoustic requirements are determined by two factors. The first is the very condition of an educational environment, whose primary function is the learning process, for which communication is essential and regarding the field of acoustics concerns, the clarity of the message transmitted orally. The second factor is related to a group of users who have physical characteristics and spatial requirements that must be met from an architectural design point of view. An additional aspect to consider is that the use of space differs from a traditional classroom dynamics, since children that age, appropriate and modify their spatial occupation in several ways. The evaluated space was a square shaped classroom made of a brick based building system, which is a proper representation of the building systems used in traditional preschool educational spaces in the city of Medell{\'{i}}n, where the study was conducted. The methodology that was used in this study, focused on evaluating the intelligibility of the space, by both, theoretical calculations and field tests, with measurements and analysis processes that were adjusted to the physical conditions of children, such as the equipment heights and the representation of the phenomenon, besides considering three groupings identified as the most common in kindergartens classrooms: roundtable, backs against the wall and distributed in small groups. The results indicated that the quality of intelligibility in the preschool classroom, in fact, varies according to the type of use for each way of grouping. It was also concluded, that the evaluated types of grouping in the preschool classroom, create different areas with varying intelligibility, allowing to identify were it is necessary to make reinforcements on surface finishes within the classrooms, and to identify places that are optimal location for teachers. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors},

The RSS measurements can be processed to infer the position of a tag by means of a positioning algorithm. In this research work we discuss and show how to use RSS measurements from the Readers to calculate the tag position by means of a neural network, based on a Multilayer Perceptron which is trained and tested with a radiomap and learns to compute the tags position. By means of simulation, we study the proper MLP architecture and the mean error positioning estimation and precision that is achieved depending on the number of Readers. With 8 Readers deployed in an indoor area of 576 m(exp 2) we get an error less than 1.75 meters in the 75{\%} of the target area.},

abstract = {We propose a novel video visual analytics system for interactive exploration of surveillance video data. Our approach consists of providing analysts with various views of information related to moving objects in a video. To do this we first extract each object's movement path. We visualize each movement by (a) creating a single action shot image (a still image that coalesces multiple frames), (b) plotting its trajectory in a space-time cube and (c) displaying an overall timeline view of all the movements. The action shots provide a still view of the moving object while the path view presents movement properties such as speed and location. We also provide tools for spatial and temporal filtering based on regions of interest. This allows analysts to filter out large amounts of movement activities while the action shot representation summarizes the content of each movement. We incorporated this multi-part visual representation of moving objects in sViSIT, a tool to facilitate browsing through the video content by interactive querying and retrieval of data. Based on our interaction with security personnel who routinely interact with surveillance video data, we identified some of the most common tasks performed. This resulted in designing a user study to measure time-to-completion of the various tasks. These generally required searching for specific events of interest (targets) in videos. Fourteen different tasks were designed and a total of 120 min of surveillance video were recorded (indoor and outdoor locations recording movements of people and vehicles). The time-to-completion of these tasks were compared against a manual fast forward video browsing guided with movement detection. We demonstrate how our system can facilitate lengthy video exploration and significantly reduce browsing time to find events of interest. Reports from expert users identify positive aspects of our approach which we summarize in our recommendations for future video visual analytics systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Nowadays, it is clear that location systems are increasingly present in people's lives. In general people often spend 80–90{\%} of their time in indoor environments, which include shopping malls, libraries, airports, universities, schools, offices, factories, hospitals, among others. In these environments, GPS does not work properly, causing inaccurate positioning. Currently, when performing the location of people or objects in indoor environments, no single technology can reproduce the same results achieved by the GPS for outdoor environments. One of the main reasons for this is the high complexity of indoor environments where, unlike outdoor spaces, there is a series of obstacles such as walls, equipment and even people. Thus, it is necessary that the solutions proposed to solve the problem of location in indoor environments take into account the complexity of these environments. In this paper, we propose an adaptable platform for indoor location, which allows the use and combination of different technologies, techniques and methods in this context. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract = {In this paper, an experimental platform for indoor location and tracking using ultra wideband (UWB) signals is presented. The platform has been developed entirely using standard electronic components that are commercially available. As principal goal, the experimental platform should allow a rapid performance evaluation for various system architectures and signal processing algorithms. Hence, the platform has to be as versatile as possible while remaining optimized for accurate location estimation. To meet these targets, the UWB receivers are implemented using a fast analog to digital converter (ADC) and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The ADC acquires directly the received radio frequency signal. The FPGA can be programmed to perform the required signal processing in real time. First results from the measurement of the time of arrivals are available and are presented. During the development of the experimental platform, the following application scenario has been assumed: An object or a person equipped with an active tag should be located or tracked in an indoor environment. It is hence required, that the system provides accurate position information even for a multipath propagation channel. On the other hand, the communication range is limited to some tens of meters and the maximum velocity of the tag is low. For a practical system, the tag should have low power consumption and small size. As the tags do not estimate the positions themselves in this scenario, they do currently not contain a radio receiver. In consequence, they are not using any channel access method, which limits either the number of active tags in one cell or the individual update rate. However, due to the short duration of one transmitted frame (150 $\mu$s), the probability that a collision occurs is small enough for many applications. As an example, 100 active tags in one cell and a position update each minute, the probability of collision is only 2.5 {\textperiodcentered} 10-4. One frame to be transmitted consists of 16 pulses with an average delay between them of 10 $\mu$s. The delays between consecutive pulses can be altered by some nanoseconds to generate a pulse position modulated signal which is used to unambiguously identify the tag. The generated signal covers a -10 dB bandwidth of about 750 MHz. The frame is emitted using a wideband antenna and propagated through the indoor propagation channel. Four synchronized UWB receivers at known positions capture the received signal. After amplification, the ADC08D1500 from National Semiconductor is used to sample the signal with up to 3 GS/s and convert it to a stream of 8 bit digital data. The digital data is processed in real time using an EP2C70 FPGA from Altera. For the indoor location demonstrator, the FPGA stores a timestamp for the time of arrival of the frame and identifies the tag. The timestamps from the four UWB receivers are then collected on a standard PC. Based on the timestamps, the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the frame between two receivers is calculated. In a first experience, the emitter remained at a given position and PC stored the TDOAs during 15 min while three people were working and moving around in the laboratory. The acquired data show a nearly Gaussian probability density function for the TDOA estimation with a standard deviation of 500 ps. This corresponds to a 95{\%} probability that the resulting distance estimation is not more than 30 cm off compared to the average of the estimated distances. The measurements for the accuracy of the TDOA estimation and the extension to a two-dimensional location system are currently ongoing. The final results will be provided in the final paper.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a comprehensive channel modeling and characterization study for visible light communications. Our study is based on ray tracing, which allows for an accurate description of the interaction of rays emitted from the lighting source within a specified confined space. Contrary to existing works, which are mainly limited to ideal Lambertian sources and purely diffuse reflections, our approach is capable of obtaining channel impulse responses (CIRs) for any nonideal sources, as well as specular and mixed specular-diffuse reflections. Furthermore, we can precisely reflect the presence of objects (e.g., furniture) and wavelength-dependent reflection characteristics of surface materials (e.g., ceilings, floor, walls, and furniture) in a channel study. As case studies, we consider a number of indoor environments with various dimensions and different surface materials, i.e., plaster, gloss paint, wood, aluminum metal, and glass. We further consider various scenarios with different transmitter specifications (i.e., single versus multiple transmitters and array type) and receiver specifications (i.e., location and rotation). For each environment, we obtain CIRs and present a channel characterization study where channel parameters, such as channel DC gain, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, coherence bandwidth, and mean excess delay, are obtained. We also make one-to-one comparisons between infrared and visible-light CIRs for the same environments to emphasize the differences between two optical bands.},

abstract = {An active camera tracking system (ACTS) is comprised of a camera that can rotate automatically toward an object of interest so the object remains within the camera's field of view. To rotate the camera toward an object, the camera needs to detect the object's location. Detecting an object's location can be achieved using image processing techniques. However, conventional image processing techniques require expensive calculations in addition to expensive hardware, which in turn limits the video frame processing speed. In this paper, we propose an effective ACTS to monitor and track objects automatically with high accuracy. The proposed approach automatically initializes the object to be tracked using an absolute difference motion detection technique. To track the object correctly, the minimum output sum of squared error (MOSSE) adaptive correlation tracker is applied to provide an accurate and fast visual tracking. We also implemented an accurate scale estimation for the visual tracking technique that detects the scale changes of the object. Additionally, the proposed ACTS uses a closed loop controller to control the pan-tilt speed of the system. By combining these techniques, the proposed ACTS can provide accurate tracking with smooth rotation. {\textcopyright} 2016 SERSC.},

In the first stage, we propose a system that recognizes the location of a user from the image sequence of an indoor environment using its onboard camera. The location information is added to the user's view in the form of 3D objects and audio sounds with location information and navigation instruction content via augmented reality (AR). The location is recognized by using the prior knowledge about the layout of the environment and the location of the AR markers. The image sequence can be obtained using a smart phone's camera and the marker detection, 3D object placement and audio augmentation will be performed by the phone's operating processor and graphical/audio modules. Using this system will majorly reduce the hardware complexity of such navigation systems, as it replaces a system consisting of a mobile PC, wireless camera, head-mounted displays (HMD) and a remote PC with a smart phone with camera. In the second stage, the same algorithm is employed as a novel vision-based autonomous humanoid robot localization and navigation approach. The proposed technique is implemented on a humanoid robot NAO and improves the robot's navigation and localization performance previously done using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) by presenting location-based information to the robot through different AR markers placed in the robot environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Visual surveillance and monitoring of indoor environments using multiple cameras has become a field of great activity in computer vision. Usual 3D tracking and positioning systems rely on several independent 2D tracking modules applied over individual camera streams, fused using geometrical relationships across cameras. As 2D tracking systems suffer inherent difficulties due to point of view limitations (perceptually similar foreground and background regions causing fragmentation of moving objects, occlusions), 3D tracking based on partially erroneous 2D tracks are likely to fail when handling multiple-people interaction. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a Bayesian framework for combining 2D low-level cues from multiple cameras directly into the 3D world through 3D Particle Filters. This method allows to estimate the probability of a certain volume being occupied by a moving object, and thus to segment and track multiple people across the monitored area. The proposed method is developed on the basis of simple, binary 2D moving region segmentation on each camera, considered as different state observations. In addition, the method is proved well suited for integrating additional 2D low-level cues to increase system robustness to occlusions: in this line, a na{\"{i}}ve color-based (HSI) appearance model has been integrated, resulting in clear performance improvements when dealing with complex scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {MS Kinect, a motion sensor, developed as a game console for the XBOX360, is a Flash-LiDAR-type sensor. Earlier investigations have confirmed that good accuracy can be achieved with that inexpensive device. As the returned depth image is coarsely quantized and the spacing of the points is growing with the object distance, the accuracy degrades at larger object distances. If the measured object morphology is known, this effect can be compensated, and, consequently, consistent accuracy can be maintained over the entire range. In positioning applications, targets, such as spheres, are frequently used, and thus, target fitting methods can result in highly accurate target-sensor distance estimation. If multiple targets are detectable in a sequence of depth images, the sensor locations can be determined by resection. The paper provides a performance evaluation of the method applied to,indoor platform positioning and mapping.

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study conducted to facilitate the use of RFID on construction job sites. The study focuses on deployment settings to provide data acquisition with higher accuracy for indoor location sensing. It provides extension to the state-of-the-art in this field as it addresses the impact of metal media proximity to RFID tags, the reasonable duration for data capturing, number of RFID tags employed and the distance between them. Low cost passive RFID tags were used in the experiments where each tag is used as a reference point with a known location. Five hundred and forty (514) experiments were conducted in lab environment using a 3m by 3m test bed that is dynamically rearranged to generate 15 test beds and a total of 67713 data sets were collected and analyzed. The collected data were captured from nine locations for each test bed at four time intervals. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) was used as the main attribute for signal measurement to process the captured data. Results of the data analysis performed are studied under four main categories: duration, number of tags, locations of tags and metal interference. The best duration was found to be the 15 second in the test bed with the least number of tags; as the short amount of time to capture data did not allow creation of a lot of interference among the emitted signals. Within each test bed, errors occurred most at points where the received signals were not well distributed in a 360 degree vicinity of the data capturing point. It means that the center point of each test bed resulted in lowest errors and the points located on the extremities led to the highest errors. Finally, metal objects were found to have major impact on the accuracy of the captured data; to the level where reliable values for errors could not be calculated in the test beds attached to metal objects. In summary, the results of the experimental study and related findings are expected to provide guidelines to the users of RFID technology for localization in building construction.},

abstract = {Indoor positioning methods using location-sensitive features of available wireless signals can achieve high accuracy. In particular, many state-of-the-art methods exploit quite unique sets of location-dependent received signal strength (RSS) measurements from multiple wireless local area network (WLAN) access points (APs), also called as wireless fingerprints. However, reception of signals from WLAN APs is not often stable, and RSS measurements tend to be unavailable due to WLAN card or AP transient effects, limited sensitivity of WLAN cards, and fluctuating attenuation and reflection of signals due to a multipath environment, structural changes and moving objects. In certain hostile scenarios, bogus APs may be installed to disorient WLAN localisation algorithms. In this study, two approaches are proposed to mitigate the impact of faulty signal strength measurements. Performance figures are provided for both simulated and empirical environments in order to support conclusions.},

The indoor positioning system can be used in many practical applications, for example, in detecting the location of moving objects, such as a person or a wheelchair, and navigation within a wide indoor area. Indoor positioning systems seem to require a higher positioning accuracy compared with systems for use in outdoor areas. The authors have previously proposed a solution for indoor positioning using ultrasonic sensors. However, these suffer from a shortcoming in that users have to possess a special ultrasonic transmitter. The system proposed here does not need such a transmitter, because a smartphone is used as the sound source. Smartphones are already widely used, so the proposed system seems to be easy to introduce for practical use. The sound transmitted from the smartphone has been investigated and confirmed, as has the validity of the developed receiving unit which makes use of the timer count values of a microcomputer, which gives an indication of the timing of the detection of sound from the smartphone. Positioning tests for static and moving objects have been carried out in both quiet and noisy environments. It has been verified that the positioning accuracy is sufficient for navigation for visually impaired persons and for other applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Indoor Geolocation can be seen as an alternative for Global Positioning System as, GPS fails in an indoor area. As an emerging technology there are two main classes of infrastructure based on which these systems are built. There are basic challenges which these systems have to face and they include the signaling systems, cost of deployment, and accuracy of prediction, pattern recognition and use of signature databases. The use of appropriate methods with proper estimation values gives better accuracy. There are various methods depending on which these systems are implemented. Indoor Geolocation has various techniques to determine the position of the object. This paper has a comparative study of the two main techniques of RSSI. Also a design for one of the applications of Indoor Geolocation i.e. a system that can be implemented for a medical store has been proposed. The basic aim is to find the RSSI value based on which the mobile station can be located. The RSSI values can be modified for any changes in the environment. An algorithm that combines the best features of the calibration procedures, fingerprinting techniques and pattern recognition helps to implement the system with best accuracy in results. For different applications, the values the various methods of determination can be selected as per requirements. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose an indoor positioning and navigation system that guides a user from point A to point B indoors with high accuracy while augmenting their situational awareness. This system has three major components: location recognition (a hybrid indoor localization app that uses Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and Google Tango to provide high accuracy), object recognition (a body-mounted camera to provide the user momentary situational awareness of objects and people), and semantic recognition (map-based annotations to alert the user of static environmental characteristics). This system also features personalized interfaces built upon the unique experiences that both BVI and ASD individuals have in indoor wayfinding and tailors its multimodal feedback to their needs. Here, the technical approach and implementation of this system are discussed, and the results of human subject tests with both BVI and ASD individuals are presented. In addition, we discuss and show the system's user-centric interface and present points for future work and expansion. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

Therefore, a user's position and orientation clearly reflect their context. Especially, orientation information can reflect a more detailed context than that obtained merely according to location: people standing face-to-face or back-to-back would have vastly different contexts. The analyses explained in this paper particularly examine an object's orientation and describe a new method for estimating an object's position and orientation in an indoor, real-world environment.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a support system for daily living activities based on a user's behavior log in an indoor environment. Generally speaking, daily living activities hardly remain in our memory, so that, determining the order and priority of daily tasks can be difficult. There are studies supporting daily chores based on a behavior log and aiming to improve the work efficiency by using a memory aid. However, most of the existing studies require pre-installation of costly devices such as cameras and sensors, and are limited to supporting a particular task or purpose. There have been proposed many methods based on Augmented Reality (AR) which annotate captured images of the real world with texts, but text-based information may frustrate users. More intuitive user interfaces are required. In this paper, we first propose a user's behavior log management technique which associates each activity log with an object/location in the target indoor space. Then, we propose a method for reproducing AR-based visual effects on the object/location determined based on the log; the method naturally navigates the user to carrying out the intended task. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed method and have conducted subjective surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed visual effects. We thereby, confirmed that the proposed visual effects can make users more intuitively aware of the intended task than the text-based annotation method. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a solution for automated inventory and object detection applications. However, if RFID tags are attached to metal objects, detection errors may occur due to Foucault currents and interferences caused by multiple simultaneous reflections. Errors may increase if metal objects are moving. The paper presents a novel algorithm using RFID low-level reader variables, such as RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), phase angle, and Doppler shift, to detect and trace metal objects. The algorithm was designed to identify if a tag is static or moving and, in the latter case, to compute its speed and direction. The algorithm differs from previous approaches since it uses a simple setup with one commercial portal reader coupled with one single element antenna. Experiments employed one tag located on one metal moving object and 12 static interferer tags, in both outdoor and indoor locations. Results show that the algorithm identifies static tags with no errors. For moving tags, the algorithm shows a maximum 12{\%} error. The algorithm correctly estimates direction and computes object speed. Test conditions emulate fork lift speeds when carrying objects in an industrial warehouse. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wendy Navarro et al.},

The novelty of the positioning algorithm lies in a hybrid approach of making use of both frequency and variable phase of the transmitted signal. The algorithm has the capability of estimating the position of an object with localization error in millimeters when the signal passes through an optical channel. The LEDs are modulated at very high frequencies. The simulation results demonstrate that the positioning error is reasonably reduced compared with other existing approaches (algorithms). Unlike existing work, the current work also evaluates the performance of the positioning algorithm in the presence of different noise distributions and shows that 1-2 cm positioning accuracy can be achieved in the presence of the noise.

In this paper, RFID is used for indoor object positioning system and we focus on the scenario of goods allocation in a warehouse. An Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is trained via a minimization of the Localized Generalization Error (L-GEM) to learn the object location based on received RFID signals from multiple RFID readers. Goods are stacked in 3-Dimensional ways in a warehouse, the RBFNN outputs 3-D vectors as the predicted locations of target goods. The proposed method is robust to uncertainty and changes in environment. Using MATLAB simulations, the experimental result shows that the proposed method yields an efficient indoor positioning. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Obstacle detection is a fundamental issue of robot navigation and there have been several proposed methods for this problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach to find out obstacles on Depth Camera streams. The proposed approach consists of three stages. First, preprocessing stage is for noise removal. Second, different depths in a frame are clustered based on the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering algorithm. Third, the objects of interest are detected from the obtained clusters. Beside that, it gives an improvement in the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering algorithm to reduce the time consuming. In theory, it is at least 3700 times better than the original one, and approximate 980100 in practice on our depth frames. The results conducted on frames demonstrate that the distance from the camera to objects retrieved is exact enough for indoor robot navigation problems.},

The proposed system aims to provide services in small or mid-scale environments such as inside a building or campus of school where conventional positioning data such as GPS, WIFI signals are often not available. Toward this end, we adapt and improve existing vision-based techniques in order to handle issues in the indoor environments. We firstly design an image acquisition system to collect visual data. On one hand, a robust visual odometry method is adjusted to precisely create the routes in the environment. On the other hand, we utilize the Fast-Appearance Based Mapping algorithm that is may be the most successful for matching places in large scenarios. In order to better estimate robot's location, we utilize a Kalman Filter that combines the matching results of current observation and the estimation of robot states based on its kinematic model. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed system is feasible to navigate the visually impaired people in the indoor environments. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Addressing and geolocation for indoor environments are important fields of research in the recent years. The problem of finding location of objects in indoor spaces is proposed to solve in two ways. The first, is to assign coordinates to objects and second is to divide space into cells and detect the presence or absence of objects in each cell to track them. In this paper the second approach is discussed by using Radio Frequency Identification technology to identify and track high value objects in jewellery retail industry. In Ubiquitous Sensor Networks, the reactivity or proactivity of the environment are important issues. Reactive environments wait for a request to response to it. Instead, in proactive spaces, the environment acts in advance to deal with an expected action. In this research, a geo-sensor network containing RFID readers, tags, and antennas which continuously exchange radio frequency signal streams is proposed to manage and monitor jewellery galleries ubiquitously. The system is also equipped with a GIS representation which provides a more user-friendly system to manage a jewellery gallery.},

The proposed system assists mobile robot to determine the factors of path planning for indoor environment with the focus on straight lines before starting its navigation. The system imitates the human's visual perception process, intentions and thought. First, it detects the partially occluded target object using Optimal Curve Segment (OCS) method which reconstructs the occluded object portion of shape by object shape models and achieves nearly 0.80 of similarity between the reconstructed partially occluded objects and complete object shape by reducing the already existing dissimilarity rate by 50 {\%}. The conical cognitive map for a straight line focus estimate of the target object location, decides the distance value of forward movement before preceding its navigation and angle of deviation of turning direction like left and right movements of the human eye. Vision guided cognitive maps replace the range finding sensors for distance estimation in mobile robots. It reduces the unwanted grid cell search in 2D-metric map of the environment.

Thus, introducing spatial index to tackle the operation efficiency problem is strongly demanded for indoor related scenes, and this method is sounding for indoor spatial objects. Nevertheless, this solution always meets a performance bottleneck. And this performance bottleneck of spatial index pervasively exists in the current compact indoor application scenes. To mitigate this problem, this paper tries to combine the R* tree index with the Hilbert curve, and proposes an innovative Hilbert curve based index. The succeeding experiment is designed to compare the performance of proposed index with the classic R* index. The test result shows the new index has successfully alleviated the execution efficiency for multi-type spatial operations, especially on critic indicators of spatial index performance. {\textcopyright} 2018, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

ZigBee is very cheap and less power consuming wireless techniques comparing to other types such as RFID, infrared and ultrasound. Thus this paper compares conventional techniques for predicting mobile object's location by combining estimates drawn from Received Signal Strength (RSS) using ZigBee modules. We classify these mechanisms into two categories; map-based localization techniques, referring to database of predefined locations and their RSSI data; and distance-based localization using Markov Chain inference. Our results show the relationship between RSSI and distance in indoor ZigBee environment and compare localization accuracy of those two techniques. We conclude that map-based localization is not suitable for flexible changes in indoors because of its predefined condition setup and lower accuracy comparing to distance-based Markov Chain inference localization system. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Visual crowdsourcing (VCS) offers an inexpensive method to collect visual data for implementing tasks, such as 3D mapping and place detection, thanks to the prevalence of smartphone cameras. However, without proper guidance, participants may not always collect data from desired locations with a required Quality-of-Information (QoI). This often causes either a lack of data in certain areas, or extra overheads for processing unnecessary redundancy. In this work, we propose SnapTask, a participatory VCS system that aims at creating complete indoor maps by guiding participants to efficiently collect visual data of high QoI. It applies Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques to reconstruct 3D models of indoor environments, which are then converted into indoor maps. To increase coverage with minimal redundancy, SnapTask determines locations for the next data collection tasks by analyzing the coverage of the generated 3D model and the camera views of the collected images. In addition, it overcomes the limitations of SfM techniques by utilizing crowdsourced annotations to reconstruct featureless surfaces (e.g. glass walls) in the 3D model. According to a field test in a library, the indoor map generated by SnapTask successfully reconstructs 100{\%} of the library walls and 98.12{\%} of objects and traversal areas within the library. With the same amount of input data our design of guided data collection increases the map coverage by 20.72{\%} and 34.45{\%}, respectively, compared with unguided participatory and opportunistic VCS. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Analysing the dynamic content of a scene observed by a mobile camera often requires the segmentation of each image of the sequence into region entities of apparent homogeneous motion. To each region is associated a 2D polynomial model (e.g., an affine one) able to describe at each location the underlying 2D “true” motion with a predefined precision $\eta$. Thanks to the use of a multiresolution robust estimator [1] to compute the motion models, the determination of the boundaries between the different regions, which is stated as a statistical regularization based on multiscale Markov Random Field (MRF) models, can be achieved in one pass only. This avoids the time consuming iterations between motion estimation and boundary identification that are encountered in almost all other motion-segmentation schemes (for instance [2, 3, 4]). We explicitly detect areas where the error between the underlying motion and the one given by the estimated models is not whithin the precision $\eta$. This allows us to handle the appearance of new objects in the scene. We have performed numerous experiments with real indoor and outdoor image sequences which demonstrate the efficiency of the method. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.},

abstract = {Object tracking from camera images is a key technique in the field of computer vision. Because the most representative application of this technique is security or surveillance, objects such as pedestrians or vehicles in public spaces are considered as tracking targets. However, it is also useful to track objects such as daily items found in indoor living spaces, including offices, private rooms, and other locations, when they go missing or need to be located. However, it is not known in advance which part of the living space can move as a single object to be tracked. Moreover, because objects in a living space do not move by themselves but are moved by human hands, the bodies of objects in motion are usually occluded by the hands for a relatively long period of time, and drastic changes in the position and appearance of the objects may occur after a long-term occlusion. In this article, we propose an approach to finding the correspondence between objects observed before and after their occlusion for object tracking purposes by detecting the grasp and release of such objects by the same hand. Segmentation of the body of each object is also realized through the detection of its grasp and release. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Precise localization of mobile robots is critical issue in military, industrial and show business applications. In the literature, several localization techniques has been proposed, in which reader is carried by the mobile object. But in this study a passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag is attached to mobile robot and the reader antennas being dispersed around the environment. This novelty protects the mobile robot from an increase of weight and results in saving in battery consumption. Also by this way, an increase in mobile object requires a mere increase in low cost passive RFID tags in the navigation system. We have applied a signal pattern matching algorithm, Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) and Selective Adaptive Weighted Localization (SAWCL) algorithms to locate the tag via Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and we compare the results. In this study a pilot application is implemented and a prototype is developed to show the proof of concept of the system. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {An indoor positioning system is a network of devices used to wirelessly locate objects or people inside a building. When it comes to the widespread adoption of indoor positioning and navigation tools among users, technology is not often a barrier, as recent advancements in positioning technologies have produced a number of low-cost accurate embedded positioning devices. However, privacy concerns remain the major consumer pushback for a wider acceptance of such services among users. An indoor navigation service enables smartphone users to navigate indoors and share indoor location-based information. It thus generates a huge amount of potentially sensitive information, including the activities of smartphone users' movements, information searched by them, and the content they share with their neighboring peers. Even though it is believed that smartphone users are aware that such positioning services are tracking their mobile activities, a large fraction of the smartphone user populations are concerned about their location and other sensitive data generated through such services. Overcoming these concerns is a top priority for both service vendors who provide indoor location technologies to retailers and mobile consumers who are conscious of their privacy when they navigate indoors. In this chapter, we introduce the privacy risks and threats related to indoor positioning systems and the state-of-the-art countermeasures to protect against them. We also discuss the new challenges in developing privacy-enabling indoor positioning and navigation tools and their merits and demerits. {\textcopyright} 2015 by Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Ultra wideband technology has shown great promise for providing high-quality location estimation, even in complex indoor multipath environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of milliwatts during operation. Backscatter communication has demonstrated the viability of astonishingly low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to narrowband systems with low localization resolution. The challenge to combining these complimentary technologies is that they share a compounding limitation, constrained transmit power. Regulations limit ultra wideband transmissions to just -41.3 dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device can only reflect the power it receives. The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting the initially imperceptible signal out of the noise. This integration only works while the target is stationary. However, stationary describes the vast majority of objects, especially lost ones. With this insight, we design Slocalization, a sub-microwatt, decimeter-accurate localization system that opens a new tradeoff space in localization systems and realizes an energy, size, and cost point that invites the localization of every thing. To evaluate this concept, we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30 cm. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Location sensors and Closed-circuit Television (CCTV) cameras are widely used for the surveillance of people, objects and areas. These devices (sensors, CCTV cameras, etc.) generate a large amount of heterogeneous data, making their analysis and management difficult and very time-consuming. In the context of video-surveillance, automatic extraction of the relevant information among the mass of multi-sources information produced by these systems could significantly reduce the investigation time and facilitate their analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines data from Indoor Location Sensors and metadata from CCTV cameras to automatically retrieve relevant video segments during research of evidence accident or crime events in indoor environments. The proposed method consists in i) the reconstruction of the mobile device trajectories from indoor location sensors and ii) the identification of the CCTV cameras intersecting the reconstructed trajectories. To ensure industrial transferability, indoor location sensors data were embedded in a generic model of CCTV cameras metadata that instantiates the standard ISO 22311 (relative to digital video-surveillance contents). We provide an experimental evaluation demonstrating the utility of our approach in a real-world case. Results show that our method helps the CCTV operators to effectively retrieve the relevant video and drastically reduce the time of analysis. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

Specifically, we propose to find instances of common furniture classes, their spatial extent, and their pose with respect to generalized class models. To accomplish this, we use a deep, wide, multi-output convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts class, pose, and location of possible objects simultaneously. To overcome the lack of large annotated RGB-D training sets (especially those with pose), we use an on-the-fly rendering pipeline that generates realistic cluttered room scenes in parallel to training. We then perform transfer learning on the relatively small amount of publicly available annotated RGB-D data, and find that our model is able to successfully annotate even highly challenging real scenes. Importantly, our trained network is able to understand noisy and sparse observations of highly cluttered scenes with a remarkable degree of accuracy, inferring class and pose from a very limited set of cues. Additionally, our neural network is only moderately deep and computes class, pose and position in tandem, so the overall run-time is significantly faster than existing methods, estimating all output parameters simultaneously in parallel. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Information summarization and retrieval are significant research topics associated with recent advancements in sensor devices, data compression and storage techniques, and high-speed internet. As a result of these advances, it is possible for people to collect huge life-logs. Video is one of the most important life information sources. This paper describes a method of summarizing video life-logs in an office environment with a multi-camera system. Previously, multi-camera systems have been used to track moving objects or to cover a wide area. This paper focuses on capturing diverse views of each office event using a multi-camera system with several cameras observing the same area. The summarization process includes camera view selection and event sequence summarization. View selection produces a single event sequence from multiple event sequences by selecting an optimal view at each time, for which domain knowledge based on the elements of the office environment and rules from questionnaire surveys have been used. Summarization creates a summary sequence from whole sequences by using a fuzzy rule-based system to approximate human decision making. The user-entered degrees of interest in objects, persons, and events are used for a personalized summarization. We confirmed experimentally that the proposed method provides promising results. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Fundamental conditions to create nonnegative optical signals and brightness control are defined in conjunction with multiplexing different sources and receiving messages. By using two design methods n-1 and M constructions, Hadamard matrices can be used to implement MIMO VLC without considering bandwidth limits for emitters or receivers.

For environment modeling, we use 3D object position and depth information of the stereo camera. The 3D object position is computed with the depth of the local invariant features. Furthermore, only the depth information at horizontal centerline in image is used, where optical axis passes through. The depth information is similar to the data of the laser range finder. Therefore, we can build a hybrid local map which is composed of indoor environment metric map and object location map. Also, based on such nodes, sensing data and object recognition, we suggest a method for estimating the coarse pose and refined pose of a mobile robot. The coarse pose is obtained by means of object recognition and SVD based least-squares fitting. Based on the coarse pose, the refined pose is estimated with particle filtering algorithm. One contribution of this method is that it can avoid the local minima problem which might be occurred in a geometrically non-distinctive place with scan matching based global localization method.

abstract = {This paper proposes a framework to track a face in multi-view uncontrolled color video sequences. The method combines Gabor responses with missing observation Kalman filter to track the face. Using this approach, it is not necessary to estimate face positions even if the detection stage fails, because the missing observation Kalman filter is able to predict the face location in the next frame of the video sequence. Literature shows that tracking approach needs a face observation, returning to initial step. This work uses a preprocessing stage that actively treats the color constancy problem. This algorithm is applied directly to non-normalized RGB space, not demanding any color space transformation. Another contribution is the identification of a range for dark skin tones, not yet identified in uncontrolled color videos. Skin-tone pixel identification reduces the number of candidates to be a face region in the image and ensures that the image region is a human face. Using skin searching region the method can predict the object motion more accurately than one that performs face searching in the whole image. The proposed framework presented encouraging results for both indoor and outdoor unconstrained test videos, considering multi-view scenes containing partial occlusion and non-uniform illumination. Moreover, its capability to recover the face location not detected in a previous frame decreases the whole runtime, making it a very attractive one. {\textcopyright} 2003-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Object localization is at the core of several context-Aware applications envisioned for the Internet of Things. However, the present localization approaches are often too expensive, or are limited by indoor layouts and noise. In recent years, radio tomographic imaging (RTI) has generated great interest as a device-free localization approach. While several RTI algorithms have been proposed in the literature, their robustness and comparative performance in indoor environments, with real-world impairments, has not yet been experimentally studied. In this paper, we compare the performance of three state-of-The-Art RTI algorithms and analyze the impact of different environmental conditions and algorithm parameters on the localization accuracy. Our experimental results show that multipath propagation is the main limiting factor for indoor localization using RTI: our measurements over a diverse set of indoor locations exhibit a 90th percentile localization error of between 0.8 m and 2.85 m. Additionally, our experiments reveal that co-channel interference and external human mobility further degrade the accuracy by 5{\%}-20{\%}. Furthermore, we show that while some improvements are achieved through modifications in network configuration and the fundamental RTI algorithm, these changes (such as increased node density and multi-channel RTI) are not feasible for cost-effective deployments. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

We provide a comparison of the systems that are currently in operation or are being developed and suggest areas where enhancements may produce systems that are more effective. Because few systems exist for the sole purpose of tracking objects in a home, we also evaluate systems that are designed to use multiple cameras to perform general surveillance.

abstract = {Robots operating in human environments are often required to recognise, grasp and manipulate objects. Identifying the locations of objects amongst their complex surroundings is therefore an important capability. However, when environments are unstructured and cluttered, as is typical for indoor human environments, reliable and accurate object segmentation is not always possible because the scene representation is often incomplete or ambiguous. We overcome the limitations of static object segmentation by enabling a robot to directly interact with the scene with non-prehensile actions. Our method does not rely on object models to infer object existence. Rather, interaction induces scene motion and this provides an additional clue for associating observed parts to the same object. We use a probabilistic segmentation framework in order to identify segmentation uncertainty. This uncertainty is then used to guide a robot while it manipulates the scene. Our probabilistic segmentation approach recursively updates the segmentation given the motion cues and the segmentation is monitored during interaction, thus providing online feedback. Experiments performed with RGB-D data show that the additional source of information from motion enables more certain object segmentation that was otherwise ambiguous. We then show that our interaction approach based on segmentation uncertainty maintains higher quality segmentation than competing methods with increasing clutter. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Managing heterogeneous information related to Cultural Heritage sites and artifacts is still a complex task. In latest years, there has been a significant trend towards the massive digitization of this data, as this allows more efficient and reliable storage and management processes. Furthermore, the relationship between conservation managers, who are often unfamiliar with current documentation techniques, and information providers, who tend to be highly technical practitioners without expertise in cultural heritage, is not easy to handle. Moreover, in Cultural Heritage objects often have a strong 3D component, and cannot be easily represented with conventional data management frameworks like Geographic Information System (GIS). The use of a 3D framework may allow a closer adherence to the real world, as it respects the spatial relationships among various parts. A novel method to access spatial information through the interactive navigation of a synthetic 3D model, reproducing the main features of a corresponding real environment, is proposed in this paper. The result of this work is a system called ISEE. An innovative aspect of the ISEE approach is represented by our definition of spatial relevance of information. The information is ranked with a novel measure of relevance that depends on the position/orientation in the 3D space, and allows for an intuitive interface. The basic idea of ISEE is to allow retrieving information by just looking around in a 3D environment, as moving and looking at the world is the main modality we use to gather information from it. Users explore in intuitive way a 3D environment and access the related information, kept in its spatial context. Information are accessed through "extended zones", i.e. portions of the 3D environment not having direct reference to specific elements, rather to the distribution of information and to the current user location. The use of extended zones gives to the proposed ranking algorithm a superior performance than rankings methods based on distance. Indeed the ISEE ranking matches the intuitive expectation of the users, as was verified with a formal usability test. The system has been applied to case studies related both to outdoor and indoor environments, showing its potential also as a smart guide with the use of augmented reality technologies. In order to enable access to a larger audience, sample applications using this method are based on Web technologies and do not require special training to be used. At the end of the paper are presented the results of an evaluation test, which provided useful suggestion to improve the system usability and performances. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Wearable technologies have attracted considerable attention in mobile computing. This paper proposes a system for localization on wearable devices, such as the smart glasses. The existing approaches to localization, such as AoA, ToA, TDoA, GPS, and RF-based solutions, rely on auxiliary signals at set distances. This limitation constrains the availability of LBS when a mobile device is unable to receive the auxiliary signals. For example, GPS is not available in indoor environments. This paper proposes a system for 'self-contained' localization, which refers to the capability of a device to determine its location without having to rely on auxiliary signals, and demonstrates the feasibility of using inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual sensors in a smart phone to achieve this goal. Based on a concept called inertial sensor-assisted localization (ISAL), IMU sensors are triggered by user motions and visual cues are taken from existing objects. Using augmented reality (AR) techniques, objects captured by the smart phone camera are 'tagged' manually or automatically by image processing tools. The angles of these objects relative to the user are then measured by IMU sensors. Based on these angles, we then develop an angulation algorithm to determine the location of the user. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

We believe that access to semantic maps will make it possible for robots to better communicate information to a human operator and vice versa. The main contribution of this paper is a method that fuses data from different sensor modalities, range sensors and vision sensors are considered, to create a probabilistic semantic map of an outdoor environment. The method combines a learned virtual sensor (understood as one or several physical sensors with a dedicated signal processing unit for recognition of real world concepts) for building detection with a standard occupancy map. The virtual sensor is applied on a mobile robot, combining classifications of sub-images from a panoramic view with spatial information (location and orientation of the robot) giving the likely locations of buildings. This information is combined with an occupancy map to calculate a probabilistic semantic map. Our experiments with an outdoor mobile robot show that the method produces semantic maps with correct labeling and an evident distinction between 'building' objects from 'nature' objects.},

The mapping also substantially reduces the data bandwidth of the input imagery by transforming a video resolution image into 64 × 64 pixel multiresolution image. A model matching algorithm detects the wanted object in the LP domain. If the object is in the low-resolution periphery of the LP image, the camera must be moved to center the high-resolution fovea on the object where stereo-from-vergeance can be used to calculate the distance to the object.},

In this paper, scene recognition methods and applications are analysed, and the Bag of Words (BoW), a local image feature based scene classification model is implemented. In the BoW model every picture is encoded by a bag of visual features, which shows the quantities of different visual features of an image, but disregards any spatial information. Five different feature detectors and two feature descriptors were analyzed and two best approaches were experimentally chosen as being most effective classifying images into eight outdoor categories: forced feature detection with a grid and description using SIFT descriptor, and feature detection with SURF and description with U-SURF. Support vector machines were used for classification. We also have found that for the task of scene recognition not just the distinct features which are found by common feature detectors are important, but also the features that are uninteresting for them. Indoor scenes were experimentally classified into five categories and worse results were achieved. This shows that indoor scene classification is a much harder task and a model which does not take into account any mid-level scene information like objects of the scene is not sufficient for the task. A computer application was written in order to demonstrate the algorithm, which allows training new classifiers with different parameters and using the trained classifiers to predict the classes of new images. {\textcopyright} 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

abstract = {Traditional methods of object recognition are reliant on shape and so are very difficult to apply in cluttered, wideangle and low-detail views such as surveillance scenes. To address this, a method of indirect object recognition is proposed, where human activity is used to infer both the location and identity of objects. No shape analysis is necessary. The concept is dubbed 'interaction signatures', since the premise is that a human will interact with objects in ways characteristic of the function of that object - for example, a person sits in a chair and drinks from a cup. The human-centred approach means that recognition is possible in low-detail views and is largely invariant to the shape of objects within the same functional class. This paper implements a Bayesian network for classifying region patches with object labels, building upon our previous work in automatically segmenting and recognising a human's interactions with the objects. Experiments show that interaction signatures can successfully find and label objects in low-detail views and are equally effective at recognising test objects that differ markedly in appearance from the training objects. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Our approach is motivated by the need for fast and effective systems to simplify indoor data acquisition, as required in many real-world cases where mapping the structure is more important than capturing 3D details, such as the design of smart houses or in the security domain.We combine and extend state-of-the-art results to obtain indoor models scaled to their real-world metric dimension, making them available for online exploration. Moreover, since our target is to assist end-users not necessarily skilled in virtual reality and 3D objects interaction, we introduce a client-server image-based navigation system, exploiting this simplified indoor structure to support a low-degree-of-freedom user interface. We tested our approach in several indoor environments and carried out a preliminary user study to assess the usability of the system by people without a specific technical background. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

In the context-aware computing, one of the key competences is location determination. The accuracy has vital significance for localization estimation. The indoor environment requires higher degree of accuracy in comparison to the outdoor environment. The indoor environment is effected by reflection, refraction, diffraction and shadowing form obstacles by presenting difficult path to travel for RF signal. This fading and multipath propagation in radio frequency (RF) signal is because of different reasons like furniture, walls, the wired and wireless communication devices causing interference. These all problems are challenging and therefore motivate to develop an accurate indoor location estimation based on device-free location system.

abstract = {Location awareness describes applications in computing and telecommunications, which alter their behaviour in dependence on the location of an entity, such as the user of an application, a person the user of the application wants to communicate with, or an object capable of changing a location. Such location presents a major category of context and it is derived by various methods of positioning. Over the past two decades, positioning has been a driving factor in the development of ubiquitous computing applications demanding such location information. Many devices and techniques have been developed; however, very few of them are actually used commercially. This is because the precision is limited to specific applications, and the availability limited to the provider of specific services. Obviously, to support efficient and effective development and deployment of innovative Location-Based Services (LBSs), namely, services able to deliver personalized location-aware content to subscribers on the basis of their positioning capability of the wireless infrastructure, a flexible middleware should be build as the enabling infrastructure. This work examines various systems of LBSs focusing on their architecture characteristics and the different governing platforms and technologies on which they are based. The goal is to contribute towards the development of an architecture that combines numerous individual positioning technologies to obtain more precise and more reliable results according to the various needs of the whole range of LBSs. The general concepts of these system are discussed by presenting a first level of classification which depends on the positioning infrastructure namely, indoor, satellite or network-based configuration. Several specific LBS architectures are categorized by means of the various characteristics regarding the design and functionality of each one. Position is combined with spatial information so as to integrate a system of LBSs with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) or other location dependent information. Finally, to increase interoperability among the various systems and technologies, standardization and homogenization is also taken under consideration. {\textcopyright} Dynamic Publishers, Inc.},

The primary reason is locating the object, and navigation helps systems to make decisions faster. Secondary reason is we may detect fault and posses faster processing and operation. Another side of development and research is for cost-effective techniques involving indoor and outdoor systems. Many researchers are working on indoor positioning and developing lightweighted solutions using radio frequencies. Managing and monitoring radio frequencies in an indoor system have physical barriers; they also have some technological limitations where we can provide solutions. The solutions for indoor localization and tracking are GPS signal, Bluetooth, infrared, RFID, and wireless LAN. All these radio frequencies deal with a crucial issue of gaining RSS (Received Signal Strength). In this work, we are focusing on RFID-based indoor environment where RSS is our main attention, we also target on gaining efficiency and accuracy, stability, robustness. The proposed algorithm of this work is mainly targeting with directional antenna by which we can overcome the physical and other barriers of radio frequency. These kinds of indoor environments such as health care, loyalty management system, automatic parking allotment system, tracking services for older people, or customers inside living communities, mobile robot, logistics system, etc., can be facilitated using directional antenna and RFID tagging for navigation indoor positioning. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract = {Indoor localization, a process of determining the location of a user or an object, is important for different types of applications, such as localization of first responders inside a building, ubiquitous computing and tracking of materials in an enclosed warehouse. Different types of technologies based on ultrasound waves, infrared waves and radio signals are currently used for indoor localization. The technology based on radio signal strength is widely used as a mechanism for localization. Currently existing technologies are not able to provide localization accurately within a few meters as they are prone to different types of signal propagation problems, and they often rely on prior data on localization. To improve localization accuracy and avoid collecting prior localization data, the authors investigated an alternative technology which combines an inertial measurement system and correction points for indoor localization. The authors have developed and tested an approach based on a Kaiman filter to fuse location data from correction points and an inertial measurement system for outdoor localization. The outdoor test results of the presented approach showed that accuracy up to a few meters (3 meters) can be achieved. The same approach can be used for indoor localization with minor changes. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

abstract = {Indoor localization is needed for guiding people who are not familiar with a facility. This need is more critical when guidance is needed to locate people or objects that need immediate attention. For example, an inexperienced facility worker might need to locate a building component (e.g., leaking pipe) for repair to prevent any damage to a facility or its residents. In such situations, an approach that can help the user to reach his/her destination point (i.e., a component of interest or a specific location in a facility) based on his/her current location is desired. To provide such guidance, the location of a person needs to be determined at a given point in time. This process is known as localization. The objective of this research study is to determine the technological viability of using radio frequency identification (RFID) to support localization. To assess the capability of RFID for localization, the writers conducted multiple field tests under real operating conditions within a facility at Carnegie Mellon University. Hypothesis tests and K -nearest neighborhood algorithm were used to determine the technological feasibility of RFID to support localization. The results showed that it is possible to identify the location of a user using this approach; however, some improvements in accuracy are needed. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

The distance between the locating object and the anchor node is calculated using time of flight(ToF) and velocity of ultrasonic. Then the trilateration localization is applied to compute coordinates. The envelope detection method is used to measure ToF, which treats the highest value point of the envelope signal as the arrival time. Considering the effect of noise in the actual circuit, the measured value will fluctuate at the actual peak, it affects the stability and precision of the system. The digital lock-in amplifying technique is adopted in this paper, the result of experiment and simulation show that this method can reduce the effects of noise and interference, and improve greatly the positioning accuracy and the capacity of anti-jamming compared with the existing methods. Without considering the ultrasonic radiation, the distance measurement error is within 2 mm, and the standard deviation is less than 0.15 mm in the experiments, which is reduced about 50{\%} comparing with the best result achieved currently 0.3 mm. {\textcopyright} 2018, Editorial Office of Control and Decision.

This paper proposes an indoor range measurement based on multifrequency phase difference of arrival (MF-PDoA) using UHF RFID passive tags and discusses the measurement principle, experiment implementation, and results evaluation in detail. After a theoretical overview of MF-PDoA range measurement principle, it introduces an experimental prototype under EPC C1G2 standard for range measurements. Both our prototype and a commercial off-the-shelf RFID reader have been used to verify the measurement method. We propose a Kalman filter and weighting method to process the measuring data.

abstract = {Indoor physical security, as a perpetual and multi-layered phenomenon, is a timeintensive and labor-consuming task. Various technologies have been leveraged to develop automatic access control, intrusion detection, or video monitoring systems. Video surveillance has been significantly enhanced by the advent of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras and advanced video processing, which together enable effective monitoring and recording. The development of ubiquitous object identification and tracking technologies provide the opportunity to accomplish automatic access control and tracking. Intrusion detection has also become possible through deploying networks of motion sensors for alerting about abnormal behaviors. However, each of the above-mentioned technologies has its own limitations. This paper presents a fully automated indoor security solution that leverages an Ultra-wideband (UWB) Real-Time Locating System (RTLS), PTZ surveillance cameras and a Building Information Model (BIM) as three sources of environmental data. Providing authorized persons with UWB tags, unauthorized intruders are distinguished as the mismatch observed between the detected tag owners and the persons detected in the video, and intrusion alert is generated. PTZ cameras allow for wide-area monitoring and motion-based recording. Furthermore, the BIM is used for space modeling and mapping the locations of intruders in the building. Fusing UWB tracking, video and spatial data can automate the entire security procedure from access control to intrusion alerting and behavior monitoring. Other benefits of the proposed method include higher accuracy and robustness, more complex query processing, and interoperability with other BIM-based solutions. A prototype system is implemented that demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Tracking system is one of concerning issue in wireless sensor network (WSN) application. The accuracy of the location estimation from nodes is important parameter in tracking system. However, many various attacks try to manipulate the estimated location or try to provide false nodes data transmission. The secure and privacy data sharing of the estimation is also become another priority in WSN. Hence, this paper focuses on employing secure wireless object tracking (SWOT) system which is added by the reliable method in privacy data sharing. By proposing the transmission system based cryptographic mechanism, some parameter data that are required in estimated calculation such as RSSI, coordinates, pathloss exponent (PLE), and estimated distance will be hidden using encryption process. Due to the limited computational device, we propose security scheme without raising computational capability. Layered encryption using AES 128, RSA 2048, MD5 and SHA-1 provide high performance authentication and data encryption services for each nodes. Implementing mobile cooperative tracking scenario refers to previous work, the proposed security scheme is efficient in terms of processing time which could not influenced to the estimated location accuracy. Moreover, the authentication protocol which is adopted from one time password scenario can apply the key renewal mechanism for AES 128 and MD5 algorithm. The experimental results show that SWOT system achieves 75.95 ms processing time using Raspberry Pi devices including trilateration algorithm and security process. Meanwhile, PC server consumes around 82.7 ms for decrypting, calculating and showing the estimated position by modified iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) algorithm. {\textcopyright} IJASEIT.},

abstract = {The prevalent visions of ambient intelligence leverage natural interaction between user and available services in a learning space. In this pursuit, we present a framework for augmenting physical objects with annotated information in order to improve physical browsing. The proposed system incorporates an intuitive camera based annotation scheme to catalog and author information about the physical learning objects in an environment. Each annotated data is encoded in such a way that they provide access points for available information or services about the physical objects. The system uses adequate visual cues and provides tactile feedback in order to leverage the touch-based interactions with the objects. These real world interaction techniques with the physical environment and seamless virtual learning information acquisition make the system transparent from the young learners and help them to become engaged in their learning activities.},

abstract = {Literature indicates that frequency diversity can be utilized to compensate channel uncertainties such as multipath fading. Therefore, in this paper it is exploited for improving accuracy in locating stationary and mobile objects in the indoor environment. First, frequency diversity technique is introduced for small scale and temporal variation compensation of received signals and it is demonstrated analytically to enhance location accuracy. A novel metric is introduced in selection combining in order to achieve location accuracy through the addition of frequency diversity upon two of the available location determination schemes. The results are evaluated experimentally against the case where there is no frequency diversity for reception by using low cost wireless RF devices such as motes. An asset location tracking system is then devised to both improve accuracy and predict asset movement. Frequency diversity in terms of channel spacing of 55 MHz is evaluated and shown to provide a reduction in location determination error between 18 to 23{\%} when compared to a system without frequency diversity. Finally, results from frequency diversity are compared against the spatial diversity techniques in terms of improvement in location accuracy, power consumption of the transmitter, and hardware and software costs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

abstract = {The aim of this research is to design an intelligent system that addresses the problem of real-time localization and navigation of visually impaired (VI) in an indoor environment using a monocular camera. Systems that have been developed so far for the VI use either many cameras (stereo and monocular) integrated with other sensors or use very complex algorithms that are computationally expensive. In this research work, a computationally less expensive integrated system has been proposed to combine imaging geometry, Visual Odometry (VO), Object Detection (OD) along with Distance-Depth (D-D) estimation algorithms for precise navigation and localization by utilizing a single monocular camera as the only sensor. The developed algorithm is tested for both standard Karlsruhe and indoor environment recorded datasets. Tests have been carried out in real-time using a smartphone camera that captures image data of the environment as the person moves and is sent over Wi-Fi for further processing to the MATLAB software model running on an Intel i7 processor. The algorithm provides accurate results on real-time navigation in the environment with an audio feedback about the person's location. The trajectory of the navigation is expressed in an arbitrary scale. Object detection based localization is accurate. The D-D estimation provides distance and depth measurements up to an accuracy of 94-98{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the online localization of mobile (service) robots in real world dynamic environments. Most of the techniques developed so far have been designed for static environments. What is presented here is a novel technique for mobile robot localization in quasi-dynamic environments. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach employs a probability grid map and Baye's filtering techniques. The former is used for representing the possible changes in the surrounding environment which a robot might have to face. Findings - Simulation and experimental results show that this approach has a high degree of robustness by taking into account both sensor and world uncertainty. The methodology has been tested under different environment scenarios where diverse complex objects having different sizes and shapes were used to represent movable and non-movable entities. Practical implications - The results can be applied to diverse robotic systems that need to move in changing indoor environments such as hospitals and places where people might require assistance from autonomous robotic devices. The methodology is fast, efficient and can be used in fast-moving robots, allowing them to perform complex operations such as path planning and navigation in real time. Originality/value - What is proposed here is a novel mobile robot localization approach that enables unmanned vehicles to effectively move in real time and know their current location in dynamic environments. Such an approach consists of two steps: a generation of the probability grid map; and a recursive position estimation methodology employing a variant of the Baye's filter. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {While robot mapping has seen massive strides recently, higher level abstractions in map representation are still not widespread. Maps containing semantic concepts such as objects and labels are essential for many tasks in manmade environments as well as for human-robot interaction and map communication. In keeping with this aim, we present a model for places using objects as the basic unit of representation. Our model is a 3D extension of the constellation object model, popular in computer vision, in which the objects are modeled by their appearance and shape. The 3D location of each object is maintained in a coordinate frame local to the place. The individual object models are learned in a supervised manner using roughly segmented and labeled training images. Stereo range data is used to compute 3D locations of the objects. We use the Swendsen-Wang algorithm, a cluster MCMC method, to solve the correspondence problem between image features and objects during inference. We provide a technique for building panoramic place models from multiple views of a location. An algorithm for place recognition by comparing models is also provided. Results are presented in the form of place models inferred in an indoor environment.We envision the use of our place model as a building block towards a complete object-based semantic mapping system.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper concerns the dimensions of relevance in information retrieval systems and their completeness in new retrieval contexts such as mobile search. Geography as a factor in relevance is little understood and information seeking is assumed to take place in indoor environments. Yet the rise of information seeking on the move using mobile devices implies the need to better understand the kind of situational relevance operating in this kind of context. Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines and explores a geographic information seeking process in which geographic information needs (conditioned by needs and tasks, in context) drive the acquisition and use of geographic information objects, which in turn influence geographic behaviour in the environment. Geographic relevance is defined as "a relation between a geographic information need" (like an attention span) and "the spatio-temporal expression of the geographic information objects needed to satisfy it" (like an area of influence). Some empirical examples are given to indicate the theoretical and practical application of this work. Findings - The paper sets out definitions of geographical information needs based on cognitive and geographic criteria, and proposes four canonical cases, which might be theorised as anomalous states of geographic knowledge (ASGK). The paper argues that geographic relevance is best defined as a spatio-temporally extended relation between information need (an "attention" span) and geographic information object (a zone of "influence"), and it defines four domains of geographic relevance. Finally a model of geographic relevance is suggested in which attention and influence are modelled as map layers whose intersection can define the nature of the relation. Originality/value - Geographic relevance is a new field of research that has so far been poorly defined and little researched. This paper sets out new principles for the study of geographic information behaviour. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {We present a data driven approach to holistic scene understanding. From a single image of an indoor scene, our approach estimates its detailed 3D geometry, i.e. the location of its walls and floor, and the 3D appearance of its containing objects, as well as its semantic meaning, i.e. a prediction of what objects it contains. This is made possible by using large datasets of detailed 3D models alongside appearance based detectors. We first estimate the 3D layout of a room, and extrapolate 2D object detection hypotheses to three dimensions to form bounding cuboids. Cuboids are converted to detailed 3D models of the predicted semantic category. Combinations of 3D models are used to create a large list of layout hypotheses for each image-where each layout hypothesis is semantically meaningful and geometrically plausible. The likelihood of each layout hypothesis is ranked using a learned linear model-and the hypothesis with the highest predicted likelihood is the final predicted 3D layout. Our approach is able to recover the detailed geometry of scenes, provide precise segmentation of objects in the image plane, and estimate objects' pose in 3D. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

The video information is processed by the Video Surveillance Intelligent Platform (VSIP) to discriminate the essential images of the indoor area under stationary video surveillance. The AoI system analyzes the output of the VSIP's images and extended Markup Language (XML) image information. The AoI system is able to define and extract the essential information, e.g., a tracked individual, and it transmits only this image to the end-user. First, the AoI transmits the entire image of the indoor area to the mobile device of the end-user. Then, the AoI system transmits only the secluded tracked objects' images to the mobile device. The end-user's device portrays the scaled portrait images of the targeted object on top of the background image. The AoI system endeavors to decrease the size of the video images transmitted to a smart phone over a wireless network and to retain the comprehension of a tracking situation. The operability of the constructed prototype indicates that this endeavor is attained. The research is based on the constructive method of the related publications and technologies and the results are derived by the implemented AoI system. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

This scenario is a very harsh environment where radio communication has notorious difficulties, as metallic objects create a strong blockage component and surfaces are highly reflective. In this environment, we investigate how to dynamically allocate MAC resources in time to static and mobile users based on context awareness extracted from a legacy WiFi positioning system. In order to address this problem, we integrate our WiFi ranging and positioning system in the WiSHFUL architecture and then define a hypothesis test to declare if the link is in line-of-sight (LOS) or non-line-of-sight (NLOS) based on angular information derived from ranging and position information. We show that context information can help increase the network throughput in the above industrial-like scenario. {\textcopyright} ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.},

abstract = {The advent of indoor personal mobile robots has clearly demonstrated their utility in assisting humans at various places such as workshops, offices, homes, etc. One of the most important cases in such autonomous scenarios is where the robot has to search for certain objects in large rooms. Exploring the whole room would prove to be extremely expensive in terms of both computing power and time. To address this issue, we demonstrate a fast algorithm to reduce the search space by identifying possible object locations as two classes, namely - Support Structures and Clutter. Support Structures are plausible object containers in a scene such as tables, chairs, sofas, etc. Clutter refers to places where there seem to be several objects but cannot be clearly distinguished. It can also be identified as unorganized regions which can be of interest for tasks such as robot grasping, fetching and placing objects. The primary contribution of this paper is to quickly identify potential object locations using a Support Vector Machine(SVM) learnt over the features extracted from the depth map and the RGB image of the scene, which further culminates into a densely connected Conditional Random Field(CRF) formulated over the image of the scene. The inference over the CRF leads to assignment of the labels - support structure, clutter, others to each pixel. There have been reliable outcomes even during challenging scenarios such as the support structures being far from the robot. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy and speed of the algorithm irrespective of alterations to camera angles, modifications to appearance change, lighting and distance from locations etc. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

First, we constructed a collection of 3D models for indoor crime scenes using various popular techniques, including laser scanning, image-based modeling and software-modeling. Second, to quickly obtain an object of interest from the 3D model database that is consistent with the geometric structure of the real object, a sketch-based retrieval method was proposed. Finally, a rapid modeling system that integrates our database and retrieval algorithm was developed to quickly build a digital crime scene. For practical use, an interactive real-time virtual roaming application was developed in Unity 3D and a low-cost VR head-mounted display (HMD).

abstract = {For the location determination of persons and objects in indoor environments a variety of systems have been developed in recent years. The main methods are described and compared in this paper, i.e., location methods using infrared, ultrasonic or radio signals and optical tracking systems. Thereby it can be distinguished if the system is specially designed for positioning and has to be installed in the building or if already available infrastructure (such as WiFi, UWB or Bluetooth) is employed. The indoor location techniques can be integrated in modern navigation systems where also a location determination of the user in a building is required apart from positioning in urban outdoor environments. As most common indoor location techniques provide only 2-D position determination, however, a challenging task is to determine the correct floor of a user in a multi-storey building. In this case it can be recommended to augment the positioning system with a barometric pressure sensor for direct observation of height differences. In the research project NAVIO (Pedestrian Navigation Systems in Combined Indoor/Outdoor Environements) conducted at our University tests with different sensors have been performed. The tests have shown that it is possible to determine the correct floor of a user using a barometric pressure sensor as the standard deviation of the estimation of the height differences is better than ± 1 m. Currently a combination of WiFi positioning with a barometric pressure sensor and other dead reckoning sensors (for observation of the direction of motion and traveled distance) is tested in our office building. A typical application would be the guidance and navigation of a pedestrian who is unfamiliar with the environment to a a certain office or a person at the Vienna University of Technology. The selcted approach and test results will be presented in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Using RFID in positioning, different approaches can be distinguished, i.e., cell-based positioning if the RFID tags are installed at active landmarks (i.e., known locations) in the surroundings, trilateration if ranges to the RFID tags are deducted from received signal strength (RSS in RFID terms) values and location fingerprinting where the measured signal power levels are used directly to obtain a position fix. Using Cell of Origin (CoO) the achievable positioning accuracy depends on the size of the cell and is therefore usually several metres up to 10's of metres using long range RFID equipment. Higher positioning accuracies can be obtained using trilateration and fingerprinting. In this paper the use of trilateration is investigated in an office building of the Vienna University of Technology and its surroundings. The received signal strength from the RFID tag at the reader depends also on the distance between the tag and the reader. To convert the measured signal strength into a range a conversion model has to be deduced. The conversion of the signal strength to the distance can be performed using a radio wave propagation model. That is an empirical mathematical formulation for the characterization of radio wave propagation as a function of frequency, distance and other conditions. Such models typically predict the path loss along a link or the effective coverage area of a transmitter. For that purpose signal strength observations have been performed along a known baseline and at a regular grid in a building and in urban environment. For the signal strength to distance conversion two different models are introduced and described in the paper. In the first model a logarithmic relationship between the signal strength and the distance is formulated, whereas in the second model a linear regression using a polynomial function is used. The models are employed for a signal strenght to distance conversion in short range from the tags in indoor environment and its surroundings. In practical tests performed at the Vienna University of Technology the conversion of the signal strength to a distance has been tested. The tests have shown that active RFID is a meaningful method for indoor positioning. It can be also employed for positioning in the transistion zones between indoor to outdoor and in urban environment as well as in combination with other methods such as WiFi, UWB or GNSS. From the test results it could be seen that the mean of the residuals is larger using the logarithmic model than for the simple polynomial fit for the signal strength to distance conversion in trilateration. For this reason, the simple polynomial model provides a more accurate fit to the distance data as the logarithmic model. The range to the RFID tag is then obtained with a standard deviation of bettter than half a metre and therefore the location of the mobile user can be determined with a standard deviation of around 2 m.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that robots can model their world with Multi-Level (ML) surface maps, which utilize 'patches' in a 2D grid space to represent various environment elevations within a given grid cell. Though these maps are able to produce 3D models of the environment while exploiting the computational feasibility of single elevation maps, they do not take into account in-plane uncertainty when matching measurements to grid cells or when grouping those measurements into 'patches.' To respond to these drawbacks, this paper proposes to extend these ML surface maps into Probabilistic Multi-Level (PML) surface maps, which uses formal probability theory to incorporate estimation and modeling errors due to uncertainty. Measurements are probabilistically associated to cells near the nominal location, and are categorized through hypothesis testing into 'patches' via classification methods that incorporate uncertainty. Experimental results comparing the performances of the PML and ML surface mapping algorithms on representative objects found in both indoor and outdoor environments show that the PML algorithm outperforms the ML algorithm in most cases including in the presence of noisy and sparse measurements. The experimental results support the claim that the PML algorithm produces more densely populated, conservative representations of its environment with fewer measurements than the ML algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Localization and tracking of objects (e.g. objects or people) in indoor environment will facilitate many location dependent or contextaware applications. Localization of passive ultra high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags attached to objects or people is of special interest because of the low cost of the tags and backscatter communication that is power efficient. An augmented RFID system for localization based on a new tag called Sense-a-Tag (ST) that communicates with the RFID reader as a passive tags and can detect and record communication of other passive tags in its proximity was introduced several years ago. In ST-based localization system, a large set of passive landmark tags are placed at the known locations. The system localizes ST based on the aggregation of binary detection measurements according to localization algorithm, such as weighted centroid localization (WCL). However, the aforementioned method is easily affected by the outlier detection of distant landmark tags by ST. To improve localization accuracy, this paper propose to iteratively refine the interrogation area of the reader so that it includes only the most relevant landmark tags. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by extensive computer simulation and realistic experiments. {\textcopyright} ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.},

Nowadays, the deployment of Bluetooth nodes in industry generally relies on the experience knowledge of engineers and the cost of positioning beacon does not considered the global level. In this paper, we put forward a method to extract the number and location of BLE beacon automatically and ensure a high positioning accuracy of the indoor positioning system based the rules of indoor positioning, which use all kinds of space objects and structure characteristics of indoor map. The triangulation method was selected to study the global optimal placement of BLE beacon for localization based on indoor map. The impacts and requirements of BLE beacon placement were systematic analysed from the triangulation positioning method, indoor positioning environment and indoor user distribution characteristics. According to the characteristics of indoor environment structure and user distribution, we built an optimization model of BLE beacon placement method based on genetic algorithm which can generate the number and the location of BLE beacon. At last, the Bluetooth indoor positioning prototype system is developed to compare the experience method deployment scheme and the global optimization deployment scheme in the real indoor positioning environment. {\textcopyright} Authors 2018.},

Our method consists of two stages: First, we generate a saliency map of the scene based on the spectral residual of three color channels and interest points are detected in this map. Second, we propose and evaluate a method for the clustering of neighboring interest regions, the rejection of outliers and the estimation of the positions of potential objects. Once the location of objects in the scene is known, recognition of objects / object classes can be performed or the locations can be used for grasping the object. The main contribution of this paper lies in a computationally inexpensive method for the localization of multiple salient objects in a scene. The performance obtained on a dataset of indoor scenes shows that our method performs good, is very fast and hence highly suitable for real-world applications, such as mobile robots and surveillance. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

With the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), the business interest in location-based application and services has also increased.

Until now, researches related to IPS are still being conducted with the objective to improve the performance of positioning techniques. Trilateration is one of the techniques available to determine the location of an object. This paper proposes an improved WiFi trilateration-based method for indoor positioning system. The improved model is based on the test results which was conducted by using Intel Galileo (Gen2) board as an access point.

Most available systems apply wireless concepts, optical tracking, and/or ultrasound. This paper presents a standalone IPS using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The concept is based on an object carrying an RFID reader module, which reads low-cost passive tags installed next to the object path. A positioning system using a Kalman filter is proposed. The inputs of the proposed algorithm are the measurements of the backscattered signal power propagated from nearby RFID tags and a tag-path position database. The proposed algorithm first estimates the location of the reader, neglecting tag-reader angle-path loss. Based on the location estimate, an iterative procedure is implemented, targeting the estimation of the tag-reader angle-path loss, where the latter is iteratively compensated from the received signal strength information measurement. Experimental results are presented, illustrating the high performance of the proposed positioning system.},

The proposed ray-tracing method is based on image method. This is used to predict the propagation of UWB electromagnetic waves. First, we have obtained that the fading statistics can be well fitted by log normal distribution in static case. Second, as in realistic environment we cannot neglect the significant impact of Human Body Shadowing and other objects in motion on indoor UWB propagation channel. Hence, our proposed model allows a simulation of propagation in a dynamic indoor environment. Results of the simulation show that this tool gives results in agreement with those reported in the literature. Specially, the effects of people motion on temporal channel properties.

For level 2 clustering, a new technique of clustering is proposed, named portion clustering, is applied to further partition the area where the object of interest can be located.

abstract = {The problem of identifying moving objects in a video recording produced by a range sensor camera is due to the limited information available for classifying different objects. On the other hand, the infrared signal from a range sensor camera is more robust for extreme luminance intensity when the monitored area has light conditions that are too bright or too dark. This paper proposes a method of detection and tracking moving objects in image sequences captured by stationary range sensor cameras. Here, the depth information is utilized to correctly identify each of detected objects. Firstly, camera calibration and background subtraction are performed to separate the background from the moving objects. Next, a 2D projection mapping is performed to obtain the location and contour of the objects in the 2D plane. Based on this information, graph matching is performed based on features extracted from the 2D data, namely object position, size and the behavior of the objects. By observing the changes in the number of objects and the objects' position relative to each other, similarity matching is performed to track the objects in the temporal domain. Experimental results show that by using similarity matching, object identification can be correctly achieved even during occlusion. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2015 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

abstract = {Localization is highly required to develop the smart-phone based pervasive computing applications. Because of very poor signal strength of global positioning system in indoor areas, various indoor localization systems have been proposed in literature. Among these, received signal strength (RSS) based fingerprinting localization systems are very popular. However, these localization systems at first, need to construct a fingerprint database by collecting RSS patterns at a set of known training locations and then determine the location of an object by comparing the currently observed RSS pattern with all the RSS patterns stored in the fingerprint database. Thus, such localization systems can provide better positioning accuracy by including large number of training data, which in turn, increase the searching overhead. To resolve this issue, several clustering strategies, which restrict the search within a smaller subset of the whole fingerprint database for such localization systems, have been proposed in the literature over the past decade. This paper presents an extensive comparative performance analysis of various clustering-based fingerprinting localization systems to demonstrate their effectiveness on the large-scale positioning system in the presence of radio irregularities and wall attenuation in the wireless environment. {\textcopyright} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract = {Location estimation is essential to the success of location based services. Since GPS does not work well in indoor and the urban areas, several indoor localization systems have been proposed in the literature. Among these, the fingerprinting-based localization systems involving two phases: training phase and positioning phase, are used mostly. In the training phase, a radio map is constructed by collecting the received signal strength (RSS) measurements at a set of known training locations. In the positioning phase, the training location whose corresponding RSS pattern matches best with the currently observed RSS pattern is selected as the estimated location of the object. The positioning accuracy of such systems depends on the grain size of the training locations, i.e., better localization accuracy can be achieved with increasing number of training locations, which in turn, increases the comparison cost as well as the searching time in the positioning phase. Several clustering strategies have been proposed in the literature to reduce the searching time by grouping several training locations into a cluster and selecting the right cluster in the positioning phase followed by searching within the selected cluster to localize an object. However, selection of some false cluster degrades the positioning accuracy of the localization system. Thus, this paper aims at devising some novel clustering strategy that would reduce the searching time without compromising the positioning accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Tracking of locations of a mobile object or person continuously using smart phones using conventional Global Positioning System (GPS) puts a huge toll on the battery life of power-limited smart phones. The power consumption of a GPS unit is much more than any other sensors in a smart phone. Worse, the GPS unit cannot be switched off even if the smart phone is in sleep mode. GPS, in addition, is not effective in indoor locations because suitable number of satellites cannot be obtained for acceptable communication. To overcome these problems, in this work, we have proposed a low power and low cost fast location tracking system for a smart phone device that is effective in tracking continuous locations of a moving device with very good accuracy. The inbuilt sensors of a smart phone like the accelerometer, the magnetometer and the gyroscope have been utilized, instead of the costly GPS unit, to track the continuous locations of a mobile device. Distance covered between any two time instants is calculated using the accelerometer readings, while the magnetometer readings give the direction of movement of the mobile device. These sensors are used to get an initial estimate of the number of foot counts and the average foot length of the person that carries the smart phone. Basically, a pattern has been framed using the change of acceleration due to gravity when a footstep is taken. These values are then used to continuously find the location of a mobile person carrying the device. The system based on these sensor measures has been implemented on Android based smart phone devices. Implementation results have generated an accuracy level of as low as 2 meters distance. The system has been tested on both indoor as well as outdoor locations without any observable differences in performance measures. Huge savings in terms of battery power consumption, as high as 20 percent for a run of 3 hours, have been found, with savings increasing rapidly with the increase in time of run of our system. Our results strongly suggest the use of our proposed system as a good alternative for the costly GPS system of location tracking. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

The existing methods fail to return similar objects when the region of interest is not specified correctly in a query image. Furthermore, when the feature vector is large, the retrieval from big collections is usually computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an object retrieval method, which is based on the neural codes (activations) generated by the last inner-product layer of the Faster R-CNN network demonstrating that it can be used not only for object detection but for retrieval too. To evaluate the method, we have used a subset of ImageNet comprising of images related to indoor scenes, and to speed-up the retrieval, we first process all the images from the dataset and we save information (i.e. neural codes, objects present in the image, confidence scores and bounding box coordinates) corresponding to each detected object. Then, given a query image, the system detects the object present and retrieves its neural codes, which are then used to compute the cosine similarity against saved neural codes. We retrieved objects with high cosine similarity scores, and then we compared it with the results obtained using confidence scores. We showed that our approach takes only 0.534 s to retrieve all the 1454 objects in our test set. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract = {Shadow segmentation is a critical issue for systems aiming at extracting, tracking or recognizing objects in a given scene. Shadows can in fact modify the shape and colour of objects and therefore affect scene analysis and interpretation systems in many applications, such as video database search and retrieval, as well as video analysis in applications such as video surveillance. We present a shadow segmentation algorithm which includes two stages. The first stage extracts moving cast shadows in each frame of the sequence. The second stage tracks the extracted shadows in the subsequent frames. Tentative moving shadow regions are first identified based on spectral and geometrical properties of shadows. In order to confirm this tentative identification, shadow regions are then tracked over time. This second stage aims at exploiting the prior knowledge of a shadow detected in previous frames by evaluating its temporal behaviour. Shadow tracking is a difficult task, since colour, texture, and motion features in shadow regions cannot be used for solving the correspondence problem. Colour and texture change according to changes in the background's characteristics. The measurement of motion cannot be reliably computed for shadows. Therefore shadows may be described only by a limited amount of information. The proposed tracking algorithm makes use of this information and provides a reliability estimation of shadow recognition results of the first stage over time. This temporal analysis eliminates the possible ambiguities of the first stage and improves the efficiency of the overall shadow detection algorithm. The benefit of the proposed shadow segmentation and tracking algorithm is evaluated on both indoor and outdoor scenes. The obtained results are validated based on subjective as well as objective comparisons.},

The proposed solution is aimed as a tool for historians and restorers working in large historical buildings such as churches to provide an access to areas that are difficult to reach by humans. In these objects, it is impossible to keep a large scaffolding for a long time due to regular services, which is necessary for studying a long-term influence of restorations works, and some parts of the churches were even not reached by people for decades and need to be inspected. To provide the same documentation and inspection techniques that are used by the experts in lower easily accessible parts of the buildings, we employ a formation of autonomous UAVs, where one of the robots is equipped by a visual sensor and the others by source of light, which provides the required flexibility for control of lightening. The described system in its full complexity has been implemented with achieved robustness and reliability required by deployment in real missions. The technology demonstration has been provided with real UAVs in historical objects to help restorers and conservationists with achieved valuable results used in plans of restoration works. In these missions, UAVs were autonomously hovering at designated locations to be able to demonstrate usefulness of such robotic lightening approach. {\textcopyright}2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Accurate tracking of elite athletes for performance monitoring allows sports scientists to optimize training to gain a competitive edge. An important challenge in this application is that the maneuverability of the athletes is high and the traditional Kalman filter (KF) will not provide satisfactory tracking accuracy. Further, high update rates, of the order of tens of updates per second for each player, are often required and hence, the tracking algorithm considered should be computationally efficient. In this paper we propose a computationally efficient multiple model particle filter (MM-PF) algorithm for tracking maneuvering objects. It uses a Gaussian proposal density based on the unscented KF and a deterministic sampling technique and provides tracking accuracy similar to that of the augmented MM-PF, but with much lower computational cost. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified using simulations and data collected in field trials. The trials were conducted with the Australian Institute of Sport using a localization system we have designed.},

abstract = {This paper describes an infrared-based system for tracking personnel in an indoor environment. The system uses three corner mounted infrared transmitter units, each consisting of eight infrared diodes, and a receiver unit worn by a user to determine the position of the user. Every diode of each transmitter unit scans the area sending its own unique code sequentially which can be decoded to identify both the transmitter and its beam angle when picked up by the receiver unit. The received codes are then sent to a personal computer (PC) to determine the position of the user by the method of triangulation. The prototype system built has a position update rate of once every 250ms with an accuracy of 0.57 metres. The system, whose accuracy could be improved with the use of better focusing elements for the infrared beams, should rind applications in the areas of military training, where the position of soldiers can be monitored throughout training sessions in buildings with multiple rooms, and any other applications that require the tracking of moving objects.},

abstract = {Personal location information is regarded as the most important contextual information transmitted in ubiquitous systems. Many pedestrian indoor localization systems rely on map-matching to constrain sensor errors. The maps required for computer aided localization and tracking need to incorporate a semantic structure. Such maps are not readily available and therefore most groups working on localization solutions manually create the required maps for specific testing scenarios. To provide a solution for map generation on a larger scale, we have developed a map generation toolkit that parses standard CAD-plans, to automatically generate topological maps for indoor environments. We propose a heuristic parser that separates superfluous data from the information depicting semantic building entities, e.g. rooms and doors. In our experiments approximately 95{\%} of all structures were detected successfully. After the extraction we transform the extracted building information into an object-based building model designed for the application of fast particle-filter-based map-matching algorithms. A performance test with a typical filter implementation demonstrates that the model is sufficiently optimized to achieve pedestrian tracking and localization in real-time. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Distinctive visual cues are of central importance for image retrieval applications, in particular, in the context of visual location recognition. While in indoor environments typically only few distinctive features can be found, outdoors dynamic objects and clutter significantly impair the retrieval performance. We present an approach which exploits text, a major source of information for humans during orientation and navigation, without the need for error-prone optical character recognition. To this end, characters are detected and described using robust feature descriptors like SURF. By quantizing them into several hundred visual words we consider the distinctive appearance of the characters rather than reducing the set of possible features to an alphabet. Writings in images are transformed to strings of visual words termed visual phrases, which provide significantly improved distinctiveness when compared to individual features. An approximate string matching is performed using N-grams, which can be efficiently combined with an inverted file structure to cope with large datasets. An experimental evaluation on three different datasets shows significant improvement of the retrieval performance while reducing the size of the database by two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art. Its low computational complexity makes the approach particularly suited for mobile image retrieval applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

For instance, Interactive Tables allow for a workspace that is intuitive, natural, and conducive to creating multi-user collaborative work environments. Although several interactive table prototypes have been developed, we have engineered a method using a computer vision system instead of touch screen technology, which allows increased flexibility to the end user because of its ability to ignore or even make use of objects placed upon the table and its decreased likelihood of accidental input. In this work we present a method for implementing such a camera-driven interactive table with a ceiling-mounted camera and demonstrate some of its potential uses. The vision system makes use of a novel hand detection and segmentation technique designed to be tolerant of any level of background complexity on the display and any reasonable range of indoor lighting conditions, thus allowing the highest level of freedom to the end user. It searches the results of multi-scale line and curve finding systems to locate thimbleshaped finger models, marking them as candidate fingers and performing a set of geometric and texture-based tests on each to remove false positives. Finally, it groups finger detections that are similar to each other in location and appearance, while allowing the reintroduction of weak candidates that are supported by strong neighbors, into hand detections with finger and palm locations. Results demonstrate the system's ability extract enough information from images of hands in very complex backgrounds to allow for finger and palm placement recognition. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {In a complex tracking environment like an airport many objects are tracked simultaneously. Some of these objects correlate to each other naturally, and thus the questions are how this correlation can be detected and how it can be used for increasing accuracy of the localisation system. The detection of the correlation is done by deciding if two objects are physically or logically bound or connected with each other. This could for example imply that a person is carrying a suitcase or sitting in a car, if these objects are tracked in a localisation system. The proposed approach to answer this question follows a two-step approach by checking computational-inexpensive preconditions first and evaluating a test statistic afterwards. This test statistic must be independent on the used fusion filter like Kalman or Particle Filter. Our results show, that one can reliably detect the physical binding and unbinding events and furthermore increase the location accuracy.},

abstract = {Up to now, different indoor positioning algorithms based on Active RFID technology have been presented. These algorithms use the concept of reference tags to locate tracking tags that are attached to objects. Experimental results have shown that the increase of reference tags caused the increase of positioning accuracy. However if the number of these reference tags exceeds a limit two problems can arise. The first problem is the increase of multipath propagation and signal interference. The second problem is the increase of cost. In order to improve the performance of indoor environment this paper presents a new method to estimate the tracking tags' location based on virtual reference tags instead of increasing the number of real reference tags. In this method after calculating RSSI of each virtual reference tag by its surrounding real reference tags RSSI, sensing area is divided into several sections and tracking tags location is calculated by real or virtual reference tags which are in section that the objects has the highest probability to be enclosed within. Experimental results show that our purposed algorithm considerably reduced error estimation of previous algorithms. In comparison with LANDMARC and VIRE approach, we reduced average estimation error by about 70 percent and 10 percent respectively. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

One important reason for using video surveillance is to counter terrorism. In this context, a multi-camera handoff system for person re-identification using a color-based global appearance model is presented. We address two main factors that affect re-identification performance in this paper: (1) robust features (viewpoint orientation and indoor/outdoor cinematography) and (2) re-identification or classification. A hexagonal-superpixel method is introduced to minimize the false recognition rate due to the above-mentioned challenges. First we detect the human or object in a video and use a mixture of Gaussian models extended with a trajectory-learning algorithm to solve the trajectory dilemma. Second, a novel feature descriptor is proposed in which sensitive features are extracted using the proposed Color Hexagonal-SIFT and Color Histogram Features (CHF) methods. Third, we generate a combined appearance feature descriptor for re-identifying the human in different scenes. Finally, we introduce a Time-Tree-based learning method to minimize the gallery set's overhead and increase the accuracy of the re-identification results. The proposed framework is tested on videos taken using three cameras placed in three different locations. We also tested this framework on publically available data from the i-LIDS and VIPeR datasets. The results show outstanding speed and re-identification accuracy in dealing with the above-mentioned issues. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Detecting or inferring human activity (e.g., an outdoor activity) by analyzing sensor data is often inaccurate, insufficient, difficult, and expensive. Therefore, this paper explains an approach to infer human activity and location considering the environmental sound cues and commonsense knowledge of everyday objects usage. Our system uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and their derivatives as features, and continuous density hidden Markov models (HMM) as acoustic models. Our work differs from others in three key ways. First, we utilize both indoor and outdoor environmental sound cues which are annotated according to the objects pertaining to the sound samples to build the idea regarding sounds and the objects which produce that particular sound. Second, use of portable microphone instead of having a fixed setup of an array of microphones to capture environmental sound we can also infer outdoor environments like being on the road, in a train station, etc., which previous research was limited to perform. Thirdly, our model is easy to incorporate new set of activities for further needs by adding more appropriately annotated sound clips and re-training of the HMM based recognizer. A perceptual test is made to study the human accuracy in the task and to obtain a baseline for the assessment of the performance of the system. Though the direct comparison of the system's performance to human performance is somewhat worse but the preliminary results are encouraging with the accuracy rate for outdoor and indoor sound categories for activities being above 67{\%} and 61{\%} respectively.},

Many Wi-Fi RSS based positioning techniques have been developed recently for indoor positioning purposes, but the positioning accuracy faces various challenges, including the high noise to signal ratio. In this paper, we consider two typical elements affecting the positioning performance: the slow attenuation of the signal strength, and the large measurement noise. We propose a novel approach to locate a target object in a given area by introducing a denoising algorithm based on the local linearity of the signal-location manifolds. This is implemented with a fixed set of linearization weights determined not by the signal values but by the relationships of the locations of the fingerprint samples. We also explore the relations among the prediction error and the manifold curvature, the number of APs used for positioning, and the signal noise level, characterizing the quality of the nearest point estimation with the signal measurement errors. A simple algorithm is presented to locate the target using the k-nearest neighbors in the signal space. Simulations in various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

However, in the indoor environment, since the reception of the satellite signal is disrupted severely, the accuracy of GPS positioning can not meet the requirements. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology with the advantages of non-contact, non-visibility, low cost and high positioning accuracy, begins to get more and more attention and becomes the most suitable indoor positioning technology. RFID location is a technique which is based on signal strength positioning, using the received signal strength indication (Received Signal Strength Indicator, RSSI) to determine the position of the object. In recent years, the indoor positioning technology has made great progress, especially on the verity of the localization algorithm. In this paper, we will briefly describe the basic principles of RFID, then we introduce the algorithms of existing indoor RFID positioning system.

abstract = {With the explosive growth of web-based cameras and mobile devices, billions of photographs are uploaded to the internet. We can trivially collect a huge number of photo streams for various goals, such as image clustering, 3D scene reconstruction, and other big data applications. However, such tasks are not easy due to the fact the retrieved photos can have large variations in their view perspectives, resolutions, lighting, noises, and distortions. Furthermore, with the occlusion of unexpected objects like people, vehicles, it is even more challenging to find feature correspondences and reconstruct realistic scenes. In this paper, we propose a structure-based image completion algorithm for object removal that produces visually plausible content with consistent structure and scene texture. We use an edge matching technique to infer the potential structure of the unknown region. Driven by the estimated structure, texture synthesis is performed automatically along the estimated curves. We evaluate the proposed method on different types of images: from highly structured indoor environment to natural scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate satisfactory performance that can be potentially used for subsequent big data processing, such as image localization, object retrieval, and scene reconstruction. Our experiments show that this approach achieves favorable results that outperform existing state-of-the-art techniques. {\textcopyright} 2014 River Publishers.},

abstract = {Localization is a technique that is needed for the service robot to drive at indoors, and it has been studied in various ways. Most localization techniques let the robot measure environmental information to gain location information, but those require high costs as it use many equipment, and also complicate the robot development. But if an external device could calculate the location of the robot and transmit it to the robot, it will reduce the extra cost for the internal equipment needed to recognize the location, and it will also simplify the robot development. Therefore this study suggests an effective way to control the robot by using the location information of the robot included in a map made by visual information from the surveillance cameras installed at indoors. The object in a single image is difficult to tell its size because of the shadow components and occlusion. Therefore, combination of shadow removal technique using HSV image from indoors and images from different perspective using homography to create two-dimensional map with accurate object information is suggested. In the experiment, the effectiveness of the suggested method is shown by analyzing the movement result of the robot which applied the location information from the two-dimensional map that is based on the multi cameras, which its accuracy is measured in advance. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {There are strong demands to extend existing surveillance systems with monocular cameras to create systems that can automatically detect unusual situations and issue alarms to the administrator. Most public surveillance functions pay attention to human traffic: the speed and direction of human flow. This is because these clues help to identify exceptional situations. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating people-flow speed in video sequences by allocating stands on CG (computer generated) scenes. To effectively handle crowded indoor scenes captured through a common monocular camera, we calculate an actual motion vector with optical flows and a background scene model. Because the location of objects cannot be specified by cross shots, it is not possible to relate a motion vector in a video sequence to that in the real world. To overcome this problem, we infer the motion vector in the real world by scaling the vector in the video sequence. For this purpose, we employ the "scaling factor" which is derived from a probability distribution of camera-distances of CG objects in CG images. We examine the effectiveness of our method using video sequences captured by two train station surveillance cameras.},

In this work, we study a new supervised deep autoencoder for depth image-based 3D model retrieval. We investigate both supervised and unsupervised approaches to bring synthetic depth images rendered from 3D models and real depth images in the same feature space. We show that providing appropriate supervision in back propagation of the autoencoder can help the retrieval performance. The key novelty is the new objective function where supervised classification information is combined with the reconstruction error for joint optimization. It is interesting to manifest that, unlike any other pairwise model structures, crossdomain retrieval is still possible using only one single deep network in our model. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our model on NYUD2 depth image dataset and Model-Net10 models for ten indoor object categories. We have rendered 95 different views for each 3D model and found that training rendered and real depth images together is an effective way to bridge the gap between 3D models and depth data.

abstract = {Localization of persons and objects is a current need of many industrial applications. Although in outdoor environments GPS or the cell-of-origin technique can have good results, they are very limited in indoor environments. In indoor environments other technologies such as RFID have a better performance. We propose an RFID based system, called TraceMe, to be used in real-time indoor localization. Besides localization it also enables area access control of people and objects, is able of alarm generation due to communications failure, access violation or tag violation, and is responsible for the interoperability of the deployed equipment. System specification, implementation, field tests and analysis of results are presented in this paper. As any traditional RFID system, it is constituted by Readers and Tags. The used tags are active and have the particularity of using two different communications frequencies. Besides the hardware also a Java-based middleware was developed. It is responsible to give meaning to data and to coordinate communications between all architecture elements. Final tests to the prototype were made in a public hospital.},

abstract = {Our institution has on-going research projects which utilize autonomous mobile robots in a variety of settings. These robots navigate and interact with humans and their environment. As part of this effort a framework to integrate the navigational operation and the speech interaction to react to contextual stimuli is provided. This framework provides a system which is easy to configure and modify. The basis of this framework blends the rationale of human nature with the interpretation of sensor inputs. This combination of real-time and environmental information is at the core of having situational awareness. Context-based mapping allows the system to learn an environmental context and how to identify it from real-time interaction. Context-based mapping techniques link data prioritized by contextual value to physical locations on a visual or representative map. This system categorizes objects and events in an adaptive way. By determining the appropriate behavior in a given situation, a mobile robot uses only the relevant knowledge and data. This information is stored to allow both historical and real-time data to be used as appropriate. This approach allows the robot to access the previously collected data for statistical reference. As data are collected from various sensory inputs, the weighted contribution in that context is determined. This research examined the deployment of an autonomous mobile robot. The robot was able to function in the environment, which included both indoor and outdoor settings. Speech was used for input and as response explanations by the robot. The robot was trained initially in a supervised mode, but after the heuristics and adjustments had been reached, the robot was able to balance the sensors appropriately and learn without supervision. The result was a robot that could navigate autonomously and respond to the environment appropriately. Experiments were performed to demonstrate the ability of the robot to function effectively in indoor and outdoor environments and transition between them. The robot was also able to create a defined signature for a location using sensor information. After this training, the robot was able to exhibit situational awareness in dynamic environments, answering numerous questions regarding the state of the surrounding environment.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a framework to build a 3D model for an indoor object from partial data using a mobile robot. The purpose of the paper is to obtain photorealistic 3D models for objects from raw mobile laser scanning data and digital camera information (to improve the appearance information). The proposed method integrates and analyses the relationships between the visual data and raw mobile laser scanning data. This method is capable to recover the complete density range and the shape of the investigated object. In order to obtain 3D mapping using the laser sensor system (called Lidar), this is positioned to a vertical scan orientation and the tilt actuator provides a rotation movement to the Lidar in order to perform a 3D scan. In this paper, the mobile system acquires 3D Lidar Data only while it is stationary. A 3D map of an object is created by acquiring overlapping scans from multiple locations and viewpoints using local co-ordinates for each scan and merging the scan into a single global co-ordinate system. Video registration is used to texture the scan points in order to provide photo realistic 3D maps. Some techniques are also implemented to improve the resolution of the Lidar Scan with video data. Experiments on real-world data are given to illustrate the suitability of this approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Object detection is very important to service robots. Many tasks for service such as delivery, cleaning, and health-care for elderly people are strongly related to objects. Conventional approaches for object detection are mainly based on the geometric models, because they have been applied to static environments. In indoor environments having uncertainty, they have limitation in some situations where interesting objects are occluded by other ones or small in the scene. Context information can be helpful to overcome these uncertain situations. In this paper, we adopt objects as context information to allow for service robots to predict the probability of interesting objects through observed ones. For this, an object relationship model based on Bayesian network (BN) and integration method are proposed. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method predicts the objects very well. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract = {In view of the shortcomings in localization accuracy of current multiple target localization algorithm, a method of multi-object localization based on compressive sensing(CS) and alternate iteration is proposed. Firstly, the measurement matrix of received signal strength(RSS) is expressed as the product of measurement matrix and sparse vector according to CS theory, which transforms multiple target localization problem to the reconstruction of sparse vector. Next, traditional localization algorithm based on CS is presented to obtain rough estimation of target positions. Finally, alternate iteration method is employed to further refine positions when localization results are not accurate. During the alternate iteration process, the diamond search is used to find the exact target locations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm overcomes the limitation of traditional compressive sensing localization techniques which can only locate targets in the center of grid, and improves the localization interference of the interaction between objects with high localization accuracy. The indoor operation and maintenance inspection area of a power company in Chongqing is chosen as an experimental site and the proposed method is applied to the actual inspection localization, and good results are achieved in the indoor localization. {\textcopyright} 2018, Chongqing Medical University.

This semi-passive tag has the dual ability to sense the backscatter communication between the reader and other passive tags which are in its proximity and to communicate this sensed information to the reader using backscatter modulation.

Experimental results in unmodified office environments show the performance of the sonar sensor. In particular, we document the sensor's capacity to produce 3-D location measurements in the presence of multiple highly overlapping echoes. We show how this capability makes possible the combination of a wide FOV with accurate 3-D localization, allowing the sensor to operate under real-time constraints in realistic environments.

abstract = {We study the backscattered echoes from selected targets that are extracted by an impulse radar system playing the role of a ground penetrating radar (GPR). The targets are metal and nonmetal objects buried to a selected depth in dry sand in an indoor sandbox. The recorded time-series data are analyzed in the joint time-frequency domain using a pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD). These distributions with their extracted features in the two-dimensional time-frequency domain are viewed as the target signatures. To be useful for target identification purposes, a signature representation should display a "sufficient" amount of distinguishing features, yet be robust enough to suppress the interference of noise contained in the received signals. Multiple scattering between a target and the surface of the ground is another obstacle for successful target recognition that time-frequency distributions could counteract by unveiling the time progression of the returned target information. We have previously demonstrated the merits of the PWD relative to various competing time-frequency distributions, in particular its capability of extracting a target's time-frequency signature when the target is buried at different depths. We have also used a classification method developed from the fuzzy C-means clustering technique to reduce the number and kind of features in the PWD signature templates. This is accomplished by converting the PWD signature into a point cluster representation and then reducing the cluster to a (smaller) number of cluster centers. This classification method has been further developed by associating a weight with each point in the cluster representation. We put the classification algorithm to a test against validation data taken from an additional set of returned echoes. The same targets are used but they are buried at a different location in the sand. Class membership of a target is then decided using a simple metric. The results of our investigation serve to assess the possibility of identifying subsurface targets using a GPR.},

The targets are metal and nonmetal objects buried to a selected depth in dry sand in an indoor sandbox. The recorded time-series data are analyzed using a pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD). These distributions with their extracted features in the two-dimensional time-frequency domain are viewed as the target signatures. We use a classification method developed from the "fuzzy C-means" clustering technique to reduce the number and kind of features in the PWD signatures. This is accomplished by converting the PWD signature into a point cluster representation where each point is associated with a weight proportional to the value of the modulus of the PWD. Using a modified fuzzy C-means technique the cluster representation is then reduced to a (smaller) set of cluster centers. We put the classification algorithm to a test against validation data taken from an additional set of returned echoes. The same targets are used but they are buried at a different location in the sand. Class membership of a target is then decided using a simple metric. The results of our investigation serve to assess the possibility of identifying subsurface targets using a GPR, by means of the present technique.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a simple method for localization using an electronic compass. Electronic compasses are often used to detect the heading of mobile robots. However, electronic compasses have one drawback when used inside a building: they can easily be disturbed by electromagnetic sources (e.g., power lines) or large ferro-magnetic structures (e.g., bookshelves). However, this paper introduces another indoor application of electronic compasses. We take advantage of the magnetic field disturbances by using them as distinctive place recognition signatures. We first gather information about the changing heading as our robot travels along the hallway outside the lab, and then store this information. As the robot traverses the hallway, it gathers the information from the electronic compass and matches it with the pre-stored data. If a match is found, the robot can determine its current position. We use a sequential least-squares approximation approach for matching the signature. The simulation results will show that the robot can distinguish its location by using these signatures.},

We firstly establish and update the video background using Gaussian mixture model, and apply background subtraction to extract the moving targets. To remove the shadow interference on these extracted moving targets, we eliminate these shadows by integrating color and gradient features. Then for the current frame, the four features of Hu's invariant moments, aspect ratio, attitude rate and velocity are used to make up a 7-dimensional feature vector. Totally, we extract such 15 frames by interval sampling per motion cycle, and form 105-dimension features to describe a behavior. Based on the feature representations, we employ support vector machines to classify six daily activities, i.e., walking, jogging, sitting down, squatting, bending, as well as falling. Numerical experiments demonstrate our method reaches an average correct recognition rate of 92{\%}, with high sensitivities and specificities. It is able to distinguish falling with the other different behaviors and has many potential applications such as old people remote nursing. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Most indoor business processes are based on the locations of physical objects, so building a well-formed model to represent the spatial knowledge about business process is necessary under ubiquitous computing environments. Current location modeling requires a large amount of manual effort and cannot balance well between multipurpose query and less cost. In this paper, having analyzed the requirements of typical location-based services and the suitability of existing location modeling approaches, we propose a combined indoor location model which extends an improved ‘‘directly under'' relation-based hierarchy tree model by introducing a core set model, based on the ‘‘level reachable'' relation. Through a series of modeling theoretical principles and a real example, we show that our model is simple but indoor general enough to capture both spatial connectivity and containment relationships and support more location-based applications. Furthermore, a single-location hierarchical tree model, which integrates room coordinates, the building exits, and corridor intersections together, can navigate more source and objective positions in reality and provide more than one candidate path corresponding to the changing environment. At the same time, our combined model can be more flexible to be integrated into a context-aware system model. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

The system can be easily constructed with already deployed Wi-Fi and camera infrastructures and is able to make use of received signal strength samples, surveillance images, and room map information to achieve a comparable performance. In a corridor scenario, we optimize propagation model (PM) parameters with crowdsourcing data from only several locations and establish a data table of optimized parameters for trilateration localization. These crowdsourcing data are also used to correct trilateration localization results, through which localization performance can be greatly improved. In a room scenario, we locate a human object with a panoramic camera and room map. We first detect the human object on the observed image and search a pixel location that represents the object's location best. Then, the pixel location on the image is mapped to the room map using an artificial neural network. By this method, localization accuracy of sub-meter level can be obtained. We perform the proposed system in our experimental environment, and the experimental results show that our localization system not only requires no extensive time and labor cost, but also outperforms fingerprinting and PM localization systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Our aim is to recognize objects (such as doors, elevators/lifts, chairs, fire extinguishers, sockets) in man-built environments where our robot can move. Having recognized the objects, information as to where each object can be found is transmitted to the mapping module for recording. This way the accuracy of map building and navigation can be improved significantly. To solve this problem we use feature detector and descriptor methods, such as SIFT or SURF, to narrow the scores before we apply a support vector machine. This is a classification method that, following a suitable training pattern, sorts the input images into the learned classes. Our solution follows out a kind of classification based on a 'Bag-of-Words' feature vector with the help of a support vector machine. Based on the result of this classification we do the SURF localization process with the help of carefully chosen model images. Combining these two algorithms and the models stored in a database, the recognition is manageable with success. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a facade for seamlessly using locating services and enabling easy development of an application with indoor and outdoor location information without being aware of the difference of individual services. To achieve this purpose, in this paper, a unified locating service, called KULOCS (Kobe-University Unified LOCating Service), which horizontally integrates the heterogeneous locating services, is proposed. Design/methodology/approach–By focusing on technology-independent elements [when], [where] and [who] in location queries, KULOCS integrates data and operations of the existing locating services. In the data integration, a method where the time representation, the locations and the namespace are consolidated by the Unix time, the location labels and the alias table, respectively, is proposed. Based on the possible combinations of the three elements, an application-neutral application programming interface (API) for the operation integration is derived. Findings–Using KULOCS, various practical services are enabled. In addition, the experimental evaluation shows the practical feasibility by comparing cases with or without KULOCS. The result shows that KULOCS reduces the effort of application development, especially when the number of locating services becomes large. Originality/value–KULOCS works as a seamless facade with the underlying locating services, the users and applications consume location information easily and efficiently, without knowing concrete services actually locating target objects. {\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The DPPA is designed for a Robot to move in the Indoor Environment amidst moving obstacles. DPPA facilitates the Robot to find the shortest path to reach the target by navigating the obstacles of various sizes and shapes on the way, both in real time as well as in simulated environment. The proposed Indoor environment (10 x 10) is split into grid cells. DPPA uses the distinct position of each grid cell for fixing the location of the robot along with the static and dynamically moving objects. The collusion with the dynamically moving objects is avoided by DPPA by continuously updating the present status of the Robot in comparison with the neighboring grid cells' status. DPPA monitors the entire indoor environment during every step of the movement of the Robot and finalizes the shortest path thereby resulting in minimum cost. DPPA is tested in real time using fire bird V Robot with different complexities in the environment (75 x 80). The real time results encourage us to extend this DPPA in day-to-day applications in daily life. e.g. the DPPA powered wheel chair can be used by the old and sick for their mobility in their homes. {\textcopyright} EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.},

abstract = {Summary form only given. We have developed a system in which a mobile robot can modify maps of an indoor environment automatically through change detection at planned locations. The robot is a car-like one equipped with sonar sensors. The indoor space is assumed to be surrounded by walls and has some movable objects of planar surfaces perpendicular to the floor. In the map updating process, the robot moves to a planned observation location and collect range data on the local region around itself by using the sonar range sensors. The robot's position is estimated by a localization method, and visible changes are detected by comparison of structural range descriptions with the original and partially updated maps. As the result, the map is further modified and a new observation location is selected. In this paper, we present a method by which a mobile robot estimates its position at each location it reaches by using information from dead reckoning, real sonar range data and the partially outmoded map. Simulation experiments show the method is efficient enough for localization in a changeable complex environment.},

abstract = {In recent years, smartphones have become rapidly popular and their performance has improved remarkably. Therefore, it is possible to estimate user context by using sensors and functions equipped in smartphones. We propose a To-Do reminder system using user indoor position information and moving state. In conventional reminder systems, users have to input the information of place (resolution place). The resolution place is where the To-Do item can be solved and the user receives a reminder. These conventional reminder systems are constructed based on outdoor position information using GPS. In this paper, we propose a new reminder system that makes it unnecessary to input the resolution place. In this newly developed system, we introduce a rule-based system for estimating the resolution place in a To-Do item. The estimation is done based on an object word and a verb, which are included in most tasks in a To-Do list. In addition, we propose an automatic judgment method to determine if a To-Do task has been completed. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract = {In order for robots to engage in dialogue with human teammates, they must have the ability to identify correspondences between elements of language and aspects of the external world. A solution to this symbol-grounding problem (Harnad, 1990) would enable a robot to interpret commands such as "Drive over to receiving and pick up the tire pallet." This article describes several of our results that use probabilistic inference to address the symbol-grounding problem. Our approach is to develop models that factor according to the linguistic structure of a command. We first describe an early result, a generative model that factors according to the sequential structure of language, and then discuss our new framework, generalized grounding graphs (G 3). The G 3 framework dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a natural language input, enabling a mapping between words in language and concrete objects, places, paths, and events in the external world. We report on corpus-based experiments in which the robot is able to learn and use word meanings in three real-world tasks: indoor navigation, spatial language video retrieval, and mobile manipulation.

abstract = {Indoor Spatial Data Infrastructure (indoor-SDI) is an important SDI for geosptial analysis and location-based services. Building Information Model (BIM) has high degree of details in geometric and semantic information for building. This study proposed direct conversion schemes to extract indoor building information from BIM to OGC IndoorGML. The major steps of the research include (1) topological conversion from building model into indoor network model; and (2) generation of IndoorGML. The topological conversion is a major process of generating and mapping nodes and edges from IFC to indoorGML. Node represents every space (e.g. IfcSpace) and objects (e.g. IfcDoor) in the building while edge shows the relationships between nodes. According to the definition of IndoorGML, the topological model in the dual space is also represented as a set of nodes and edges. These definitions of IndoorGML are the same as in the indoor network. Therefore, we can extract the necessary data in the indoor network and easily convert them into IndoorGML based on IndoorGML Schema. The experiment utilized a real BIM model to examine the proposed method. The experimental results indicated that the 3D indoor model (i.e. IndoorGML model) can be automatically imported from IFC model by the proposed procedure. In addition, the geometric and attribute of building elements are completely and correctly converted from BIM to indoor-SDI. {\textcopyright} Authors 2017.},

abstract = {Independent travel is a well-known challenge for blind and visually impaired persons. In this paper, we propose a proof-of-concept computer vision-based wayfinding aid for blind people to independently access unfamiliar indoor environments. In order to find different rooms (e.g. an office, a laboratory, or a bathroom) and other building amenities (e.g. an exit or an elevator), we incorporate object detection with text recognition. First, we develop a robust and efficient algorithm to detect doors, elevators, and cabinets based on their general geometric shape, by combining edges and corners. The algorithm is general enough to handle large intra-class variations of objects with different appearances among different indoor environments, as well as small inter-class differences between different objects such as doors and door-like cabinets. Next, to distinguish intra-class objects (e.g. an office door from a bathroom door), we extract and recognize text information associated with the detected objects. For text recognition, we first extract text regions from signs with multiple colors and possibly complex backgrounds, and then apply character localization and topological analysis to filter out background interference. The extracted text is recognized using off-the-shelf optical character recognition software products. The object type, orientation, location, and text information are presented to the blind traveler as speech. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The conventional systems mainly utilize additional equipment, such like dedicated sensors and cameras, resulting in higher cost and limitation in application scenarios. In this paper, we present a new gesture recognition system by leveraging the channel state information (CSI) which can be extracted from commodity Wi-Fi device. We design a novel interference elimination algorithm to diminish the influence caused by the signals reflected from static objects and the signal that travels from the transmitter to the receiver directly. After interference elimination, the system can capture the signal reflected from the hand and sample this signal. Then, the sample values are used to construct a virtual antenna array to estimate the moving trajectory of hand. At last, we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the trajectories and complete the gesture recognition. The extensive analytical and experimental results demonstrate our system can achieve an average accuracy of 0.97 for designed 6 single-hand gestures. Moreover, the system is capable of performing two-hand gesture recognition and it can reach an average accuracy of 0.95 for designed 3 two-hand gestures.},

abstract = {Stereo matching is a well researched area using visible-band color cameras. Thermal images are typically lower resolution, have less texture, and are noisier compared to their visible-band counterparts and are more challenging for stereo matching algorithms. Previous benchmarks for stereo matching either focus entirely on visible-band cameras or contain only a single thermal camera. We present the Color And Thermal Stereo (CATS) benchmark, a dataset consisting of stereo thermal, stereo color, and cross-modality image pairs with high accuracy ground truth ({\textless} 2mm) generated from a LiDAR. We scanned 100 cluttered indoor and 80 outdoor scenes featuring challenging environments and conditions. CATS contains approximately 1400 images of pedestrians, vehicles, electronics, and other thermally interesting objects in different environmental conditions, including nighttime, daytime, and foggy scenes. Ground truth was projected to each of the four cameras to generate color-color, thermal-thermal, and cross-modality disparity maps. A semi-automatic LiDAR to camera alignment procedure was developed that does not require a calibration target. We compare state-of-the-art algorithms to baseline the dataset and show that in the thermal and cross modalities there is still much room for improvement. We expect our dataset to provide researchers with a more diverse set of imaged locations, objects, and modalities than previous benchmarks for stereo matching. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recognising daily activity patterns of people from low-level sensory data is an important problem. Traditional approaches typically rely on generative models such as the hidden Markov models and training on fully labelled data. While activity data can be readily acquired from pervasive sensors, e.g. in smart environments, providing manual labels to support fully supervised learning is often expensive. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on partially-supervised training of discriminative sequence models such as the conditional random field (CRF) and the maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM). We show that the approach can reduce labelling effort, and at the same time, provides us with the flexibility and accuracy of the discriminative framework. Our experimental results in the video surveillance domain illustrate that these models can perform better than their generative counterpart (i.e. the partially hidden Markov model), even when a substantial amount of labels are unavailable. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report how the feature matching method can be applied to deal with the indoor mobile robot localization problem. We assume that a robot equipped with a laser rangefinder can scan the environment in real time and get the geometry features, and then the robot can match these features with those collected in advance to find the possible locations. This approach would face two difficulties. Since there are locations with similar features, the robot have to move around and do the scan and match several times to make sure the right location. There is another difficult problem, the features might not be fix in real-world dynamic environment, e.g. people might be walking through, furniture might be shifted; therefore, a robust feature matching method is needed for dynamic environment. This paper describes an efficient method using omni-directional feature grouping to improve the feature matching method for robot localization. With the laser rangefinder, a robot finds the 360 degree coverage information. Omni-directional feature grouping has the advantage of dividing all the features of a hypothetical position through different directions to generate multiple sets of environmental features. The method can reduce the affection of moving objects in a dynamic environment. Experimental results show that our method improve the accuracy rate and has low average errors. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {Mobile augmented reality (AR) employs computer vision capabilities in order to properly integrate the real and the virtual, whether that integration involves the user's location, object-based interaction, 2D or 3D annotations, or precise alignment of image overlays. Real-time vision technologies vital for the AR context include tracking, object and scene recognition, localization, and scene model construction. For mobile AR, which has limited computational resources compared with static computing environments, efficient processing is critical, as are consideration of power consumption (i.e., battery life), processing and memory limitations, lag, and the processing and display requirements of the foreground application. On the other hand, additional sensors (such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers) are typically available in the mobile context, and, unlike many traditional computer vision applications, user interaction is often available for user feedback and disambiguation. In this chapter, we discuss the use of computer vision for mobile augmented reality and present work on a vision-based AR application (mobile sign detection and translation), a vision-supplied AR resource (indoor localization and post estimation), and a low-level correspondence tracking and model estimation approach to increase accuracy and efficiency of computer vision methods in augmented reality. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Due to widespread availability of WiFi networks in buildings, indoor location based systems become a reality. To provide indoor location based services (LBS), finding the current location of a human, a computer, a mobile device or equipment such as a small UAV (like Quad copter) is of great interest. The most prominent method for this purpose is the received signal strength (RSS)-based location from WiFi Access Points (APs) inside a building. Considerable amount of research is carried out in estimating current location and providing different services based on different wireless technologies. On the other hand, little attention has been paid to study and analyze the behavior of the received signal strength itself. It is challenging because the intensity of signal can change very frequently due to environmental features like topology, temperature, interaction with objects etc. In this paper, we study the behavior of WiFi signals in an indoor environment for RSS based localization by analyzing signals from three different access points by using triangulation technique. Our method is based on fingerprinting method. The experimental results reveal that the behavior of signal changes very frequently. The results lead us to the conclusion that understanding signals behavior is important before estimating current location and providing different LBS. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Dense 3D reconstruction from RGB images is a highly ill-posed problem due to occlusions, textureless or reflective surfaces, as well as other challenges. We propose objectlevel shape priors to address these ambiguities. Towards this goal, we formulate a probabilistic model that integrates multi-view image evidence with 3D shape information from multiple objects. Inference in this model yields a dense 3D reconstruction of the scene as well as the existence and precise 3D pose of the objects in it. Our approach is able to recover fine details not captured in the input shapes while defaulting to the input models in occluded regions where image evidence is weak. Due to its probabilistic nature, the approach is able to cope with the approximate geometry of the 3D models as well as input shapes that are not present in the scene. We evaluate the approach quantitatively on several challenging indoor and outdoor datasets. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on evaluating the performance of NTrip/RTK solutions for accurate and precise car navigation (analysis of both the accuracy and availibility of RTK data using mobile communication). Our approach is to develop a functional system of determining lane positions on highways. A system is based on wireless radio communication among surrounding vehicles what complement and enhance the current vehicle driving system needs (lane change collision avoidance systems, vehicle tracking, lane keeping and obstacle avoidance). Because lane change collision avoidance system requires very high relative accuracies between moving objects, therefore we are introducing "moving basestation" option into our system. Relative Moving Base Software (RMBS) package is implemented in real-time into NovAtel Propak-v3 GNSS receivers. This solution provides centimeter level baseline accuracy in relative vehicle positioning. For the RMBS implementation, the moving base position is only single point position, and must be recomputed for every epoch. Therefore, RTK/Ntrip base solution is required in this system. Exchanging Position, baseline and velocity information among surrounding vehicles using the twoway PacificCrest radiomodem link, definitely improves safety and efficiency of automobile transportation on the highways. Two experiments were conducted on test routes using two cars in the combined driving conditions (highway + downtown). Both tests took place at Wuhan University, GNSS Research Center, China. One additional test was performed using an NTrip stream delivered by a free-standing mount point obtaining data from the reference Trimble NetR5 receiver. We demonstrate the versatility of the system, showing the advantages and disadvantages of each component.},

An automated understanding of thermal images can enrich the conventional knowledge-based firefighting techniques by providing the information from the data and sensing-driven approaches. In this work, transfer learning is applied on multi-labeling convolutional neural network architectures for object localization and recognition in monocular visual, infrared and multispectral dynamic images.

In this paper, a novel and straightforward method of path planning (including object avoidance) is presented as a way of navigating to a desired location within a complex environment. The system proposed uses the combination of depth information from an RGB-D camera and the object information from a Neural Network based object identification technique, to efficiently calculate and plan a path in real-time, to a pre-specified destination. Persons to be helped are identified using object detection, and the most practical path to the desired destination is calculated. The path information would be sent to the handheld device of the person being helped in the suitable form of interface, such as visual, audio, etc. The surveillance type nature of the system enables it to help multiple persons in the same area. The model was tested in a controlled environment with one individual person being guided to nearby specified locations. While the testing showed promising results, strong conclusions are yet to be made with the current system. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

The purpose of this research is to study and develop an android application called 'AR Furniture' with the use of Augmented Reality technology for design and decoration that will help customers visualize how furniture pieces will look and fit (to scale) in their homes and also can provide details of products to support customer decision. This application is a prototype to find out factors affecting the design and tracking of AR applications. This paper presents three factors that are important for designing and tracking AR applications. The principle of the application is started with analyzing images from the rear camera of a smartphone or tablet using marker tracking technique for displaying product's details and markerless tracking technique for displaying 3D models, performing feature tracking, and calculating positions to display a 3D model over the real world image. The implementation of the application can be split into 2 parts: Part 1 Creating 3D Models using Autodesk 3Ds Max and Part 2 Developing the application using Unity3D and Kudan Augmented Reality SDK as an engine for image analysis, image processing and 3D model rendering. Then we performed three experiments to test the application, 1) Image analysis with marker tracking 2) Image analysis with markerless tracking and 3) User's satisfaction of using the application. The results show that image analysis with marker tracking works well using markers which their size should not be less than 200 x 200 pixels, the distance between the camera and the marker should not be far more than 60 cm. Image analysis with markerless tracking works well with surfaces having a lot of features and at light levels of 100-300 lux (indoor light levels) with 70{\%} accuracy. The user experience evaluation shows that the weakness (2.86 out of 5 points) of the application is when a user found a problem in the application they would need time to solve it. The user experience evaluation shows that the strength (3.93 out of 5 points) of the application is the application can show 3D Object that meet user satisfaction. And the average overall user's satisfaction come up with 3.93 out of 5 point evaluation score. From the experiments, the application should be modified for better performance such as develop various maker patterns using QR code or barcode, distinguish walls and ceilings so that the application would show 3D objects on them properly, improve light robustness and make 3D models more realistic. {\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The criteria for evaluating the quality of the access points placement is the mathematical expectation of the localization error. We consider two strategies for localization of a mobile object. It is demonstrated that, for some strategies, the addition of access points can possibly increases the expectation errors, for example, the strategy selecting the most probable zone.

abstract = {An important basis of many smart city applications is knowledge about the location of persons and objects. In outdoor environments, this knowledge can be acquired reliably on a global scale using the well-known Global Positioning System (GPS). In indoor environments, both the availability and reliability of GPS is significantly limited. This, in turn, has led to active research on approaches and systems to enable indoor localization using various cooperating objects technologies. A key challenge during the development of any of these indoor localization approaches and systems is the systematic evaluation of their performance.

abstract = {The MIMO technique can improve system performance of not only communication system but also of radar systems. In this paper, we apply the MIMO radar with enhanced angular resolution to the indoor location estimation of humans. The Khatri-Rao (KR) matrix product is also adopted for further angular resolution enhancement. We show that the MIMO radar with the KR matrix product processing can increase the number of virtual elements effectively with suitable element arrangement, hence higher angular resolution can be realized. In general, the KR matrix product processing is not suitable for coherent radar because of signal correlation. However, when targets signals have enough Doppler frequency differential against each other, this approach works well because the signals are decorrelated. In addition, Doppler filtering is introduced to remove unwanted responses of stationary objects which make human detection difficult with conventional methods. Computer simulation and experimental results are provided to show performance of the proposed method.

To allow for better filtering of unintentional head movement, and to allow for a faster update rate of the head mouse, the full six-DoF pose of the head is estimated using a low-cost camera and IR markers, a 3-axis accelerometer, and a 3-axis magnetometer. The pose estimation problem was cast in a probabilistic fashion in which information from the different sensors is fused into a single a-posteriori distribution for the sensor pose. Simulations were run to analyze the influence of the proposed sensor fusion algorithm on the stability and accuracy of the pose estimation, and thus on the ability to point a mouse cursor to a specified location on a screen. Experiments were then performed validating the results from the simulations on real sensors. The proposed algorithm was shown to give more accurate and stable results than using only a camera to estimate the six-DoF pose.},

Though conventional methods show good performance in recognizing outdoor scenes, these methods does not work well in indoor scenes recognition. In recent years, high level image representations consisted of semantic attribute information has been introduced to solve this problem. However, a key technical challenge for these representations is the "curse of dimensionality", caused by the large numbers of objects and high dimensionality of the response vector for each object. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph learning algorithm based feature selection method for indoor scene classification. It performs feature selection by hypergraph regularization, which not only considers the interaction among features but also the interaction between the feature selection heuristics and the corresponding classifier. For the convenience of the prediction of the new images, a liner regression model is integrated in the framework, making the new images classification directly and in real time. The experimental results show that our approach has satisfactory performance compared with previously proposed methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid radar system that incorporates a linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) mode and an interferometry mode for indoor human localization and life activity monitoring applications. The unique operating principle and signal processing method allow the radar to work at two different modes for different purposes. The FMCW mode is responsible for range detection while the interferometry mode is responsible for life activities (respiration, heart beat, body motion, and gesture) monitoring. Such cooperation is built on each mode's own strength. Beam scanning is employed to determine azimuth information, which enables the system to plot 360° 2-D maps on which the room layout and objects' location can be clearly identified. Additionally, the transmitted chirp signal is coherent in phase, which is very sensitive to physiological motion and allows the proposed technique to distinguish human from nearby stationary clutters even when the human subjects are sitting still. Hence, the proposed radar is able to continuously track the location of individuals and monitor their life activities regardless of the complex indoor environment. A series of experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the proposed versatile life activity monitoring system.},

abstract = {Device-free localization of objects not equipped with RF radios is playing a critical role in many applications. This paper presents LIFS, a Low human-effort, device-free localization system with fine-grained subcarrier information, which can localize a target accurately without offline training. The basic idea is simple: channel state information (CSI) is sensitive to a target's location and thus the target can be localized by modelling the CSI measurements of multiple wireless links. However, due to rich multipath indoors, CSI can not be easily modelled. To deal with this challenge, our key observation is that even in a rich multipath environment, not all subcarriers are affected equally by multipath reflections. Our CSI pre-processing scheme tries to identify the subcarriers not affected by multipath. Thus, CSI on the “clean” subcarriers can still be utilized for accurate localization. Without the need of knowing the majority transceivers' locations, LiFS achieves a median accuracy of 0.5 m and 1.1 m in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {Automatic modeling of indoor scenes from raw point data has received considerable attention due to its wide applications in computer graphics and robotics. The raw point data, however, always suffer from incompleteness, noise and anisotropy in density, which make rapid reconstruction fairly challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we explore the repeatability and regularity of man-made structures, which is the crux of our automatic reconstruction of indoor scenes. As observed, repetitive structures oftentimes exhibit in indoor scenes, such as classrooms, meeting rooms, and auditoria. We detect repetitions hierarchically and extract each repetitive object separately in these scenes. The object is represented with a set of key points which are extracted by leveraging both the local and global information of the data. By retrieving the most similar models from the shape database, we align them with the input data to obtain a high-quality virtual representation of the scene, which is quite faithful to the original geometry. In contrast to previous methods, we discover the high-level structure of the scene and can obtain a complete reconstruction efficiently even in the presence of noise and incomplete scans. A variety of indoor scenes have been tested to verify the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {The extraction of moving objects from their background is a challenging task in visual surveillance. As a single threshold often fails to resolve ambiguities and correctly segment the object, in this paper, we propose a new method that uses three thresholds to accurately classify pixels as foreground or background. These thresholds are adaptively determined by considering the distributions of differences between the input and background images and are used to generate three boundary sets. These boundary sets are then merged to produce a final boundary set that represents the boundaries of the moving objects. The merging step proceeds by first identifying boundary segment pairs that are significantly inconsistent. Then, for each inconsistent boundary segment pair, its associated curvature, edge response, and shadow index are used as criteria to evaluate the probable location of the true boundary. The resulting boundary is finally refined by estimating the width of the halo-like boundary and referring to the foreground edge map. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently performs well under different illumination conditions, including indoor, outdoor, moderate, sunny, rainy, and dim cases. By comparing with a ground truth in each case, both the classification error rate and the displacement error indicate an accurate detection, which show substantial improvement in comparison with other existing methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

We represent the collection of videos using a hyper-lapse transition graph; the edges between nodes represent possible hyper-lapse frame transitions. To create a hyper-lapse video, a shortest path search is performed on this digraph to optimize frame sampling and assembly simultaneously. Finally, we render the hyper-lapse results using video stabilization and appearance smoothing techniques on the selected frames.

abstract = {Traditional visual SLAM methods employ point features to implement motion estimation and environment map construction. However, in some low-texture indoor scenarios, such as office and corridor, less reliable point features may be found, which could jeopardize the SLAM solution. In addition, scene changes among sequential images are not only caused by the position changes of image acquisition, but also by pedestrians and other moving objects in an indoor dynamic environment. Thus, feature identification for moving objects is needed as an important part for practical application of indoor SLAM. This paper proposes a point-line feature based SLAM method that combines both of points and line segments to enhance the performance of feature extraction in indoor scene, which can extract many line features from walls, furniture and other artificial objects. In this method, added line features help to gain more robust and accurate results. Additionally, a real-time object detection algorithm is introduced to identify the features extracted from pedestrians, so that to eliminate the negative effects caused by moving objects. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed method can obtain more robust and accurate localization results in dynamic indoor scene.},

First, we extend the Hough hypothesis space to include both object location and its visibility pattern, and design a new score function that accumulates votes for object detection and occlusion prediction. In addition, we explore the correlation between objects and their environment, building a depth-encoded object-context model based on RGB-D data. Particularly, we design a layered context representation and allow image patches from both objects and backgrounds voting for the object hypotheses. We demonstrate that using a data-driven 2.1D representation we can learn visual codebooks with better quality, and more interpretable detection results in terms of spatial relationship between objects and viewer. We test our algorithm on two challenging RGB-D datasets with significant occlusion and intraclass variation, and demonstrate the superior performance of our method. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Estimating the style compatibility between a pair of cross-category 3D indoor objects has received wide interests from the field of computer graphics in these years. Many previous works solve this task by extracting and analyzing the style-aware structures or elements from the input 3D models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve this task by training a deep neural network to quantitatively assign a compatibility score between arbitrary pair of cross-category 3D objects. By entirely learning from raw data, the trained network is able to capture various compatibility conditions influenced by global style features, such as ergonomics and object category relation. The proposed deep estimator is generally robust and can facilitate various high-level tasks. We first show its application for object collection organization. After that, we show how layout-guided, style-consistent object retrieval for indoor scene synthesis can be achieved by integrating pairwise style estimations into a novel submodular formulation. Our experiments demonstrate the usability of the proposed approach, demonstrating results superior than previous works and even comparable with suggestions made by human observers. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, we propose a unified multi-camera tracking framework, which can run online in real-time and can handle both independent field of view and common field of view cases. No camera calibration, knowledge of the relative positions of cameras, or entry and exit locations of objects is required. The memory footprint of the framework is minimised by the introduction of reusing kernels. The heterogeneous visual characteristics of objects are addressed by a novel location-based kernel matching method. The proposed framework has been evaluated using real videos captured in multiple indoor settings. The framework achieves efficient memory usage without compromising tracking accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

First, the framework of fingerprinting localization based on AD-LS-SVM is given. Then, the decoupled training and positioning process by fingerprinting samples is described in detail. The attention is focused on how to transfer the positioning problem to a multi-class classification problem, for which we adopt two popular approaches: one-against-one (OAO) and one-against-all (OAA).

abstract = {Accurate orientation information is the key in many applications, ranging from map reconstruction with crowdsourcing data, location data analytics, to accurate indoor localization. Many existing solutions rely on noisy magnetic and inertial sensor data, leading to limited accuracy, while others leverage multiple, dense anchor points to improve the accuracy, requiring significant deployment efforts. This paper presents LiCompass, the first system that enables a commodity camera to accurately estimate the object orientation using just a single optical anchor. Our key idea is to allow a camera to observe varying intensity level of polarized light when it is in different orientations and, hence, perform estimation directly from image pixel intensity. As the estimation relies only on pixel intensity, instead of the location of the anchor in an image, the system performs reliably at long distance, with low resolution images, and with large perspective distortion. LiCompass' core designs include an elaborate optical anchor design and a series of signal processing techniques based on trigonometric properties, which extend the range of orientation estimation to full 360 degrees. Our prototype evaluation shows that LiCompass produces very accurate estimates with median errors of merely 2.5 degrees at 5 meters and 7.4 degrees at 2.5 meters with an irradiance angle of 55 degrees. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

Much research has been done from various viewpoints on self-localization estimation and environment perception. In our research, the robot partner performs self-localization and environment recognition using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for self-localization estimation and map building. In this paper, we propose a method for recognizing indoor environments by robot partners based on conversations with human beings. Information acquired from maps is identified in order to share the meaning with human beings after the required interpretation. In this paper, we therefore propose a method for recognizing environmental maps by labeling these maps based on symbolic information developed through conversation with human beings. The proposed method is composed of four parts. First, the robot partner applies a steady-state genetic algorithm for self-localization estimation. Second, we use a map building algorithm for expressing the topological map. Third, conversation with human beings is performed for acquiring symbolic information in order to recognize object and position locations through the map. Fourth, we perform experiments and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

abstract = {Indoor positioning with smartphones is of great importance for a lot of applications and has attracted many researchers' interests these years. Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprinting has been considered as an efficient method for indoor positioning. Numerous systems have been developed based on it. Location fingerprint sampling is the first step of the RSS fingerprinting method. Slow sampling speed will delay the positioning speed and will reduce the accuracy if the tracking object is moving. Theoretically, the sampling period is about one fingerprint per second. However, our experiments on some Android phones/pads show that it may even take more than 10 s to sample a fingerprint occasionally. By analyzing the Android WiFi scanning framework, it is easy to find which part of the fingerprint sampling process costs more time. After theoretically analysis and experimental measurement, we provide some suggestions on how to improve sampling speed on some practical WiFi positioning system architectures. To contribute to the research community of WiFi positioning, we make all our measurement codes and our data sets available as open source. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract = {Virtual-real registration in Outdoor Augmented Reality is committed to enhance user's spatial cognition by overlaying virtual geographical objects on real scene. According to analyze fiducial detection registration method in indoor AR, for the purpose of avoiding complex and tedious process of position tracking and camera calibration in traditional registration methods, it puts forward and practices a virtual-real spatial information visualization registration method using affine representations. Based on the observation from Koenderink and van Doorn, Ullman and Basri in 1991 which is given a set of four or more non-coplanar 3D points, the projection of all points in the set can be computed as a linear combination of the projection of just four of the points, it sets up global affine coordinate system in light of world coordinates, camera coordinates and virtual coordinates and extracts four feature points from scene image and calculates the global affine coordinates of key points of virtual objects. Then according to a linear homogeneous coordinates of the four feature point's projection, it calculates projection pixel coordinates of key points of virtual objects. In addition, it proposes an approach to obtain pixel relative depth for hidden surface removal. Finally, by a case study, it verifies the feasibility and efficiency of the registration methods. The method would not only explore a new research direction for Geographical Information Science, but also would provide location-based information and services for outdoor AR. {\textcopyright} 2009 SPIE.},

abstract = {Location-fingerprint based indoor localization has the advantage of being applicable in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environment. However, it requires large-scale fingerprinting samples, which is difficult to calibrate manually. Existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) method for indoor localization is prohibitively slow and unsuitable for real-life large-scale fingerprinting calibration. To alleviate this problem, a scalable SSL (3SL) technique is proposed in this paper for building accurate fingerprinting from a small portion of labeled samples. From the perspective of compressed sensing, randomly selected landmark samples enable nonparametric regression that predicts the labels for each fingerprint as a locally weighted average of the labels on these landmarks. Then the object localization problem can be solved with high accuracy based on all calibrated samples. Finally, experiment results are included to demonstrate that the proposed 3SL method scales linearly with the data size. Compared with the existing LRSML method, it requires much smaller computational burden while having similar (if not better) location accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Information Institute.},

abstract = {WLAN-based indoor location fingerprinting has been attractive owing to the advantages of open access and high accuracy. Most fingerprinting-based systems so far rely on the received signal strength (RSS), which can be easily measured at the receiver with commercial WLAN equipment. However, RSS is a coarse value which simply measures the received power for a whole channel. Thus, it fluctuates over time in typical indoor environments with rich multipath effects and not unique for a specific location. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Fine-grained Indoor Fingerprinting System (FIFS). FIFS explores a PHYlayer Channel State Information (CSI) that specifies the channel status over all the subcarriers for location fingerprinting in WLAN. The system leverages the CSI values including different amplitudes and phases at multiple propagation paths, known as the frequency diversity, to uniquely manifest a location. Moreover, the multiple antennas provides the spatial diversity that can be further augmented in fingerprinting. We also present a coherence bandwidth-enhanced probability algorithm with a correlation filter to map object to the fingerprints. We conducted experiments in two typical indoor scenarios with commercial IEEE 802.11 NICs. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall positioning accuracy can be improved compared with the RSS-based Horus system. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Along with the penetration of smart devices and mobile applications in our daily life, how to effectively manage the mobility issues in wireless networks becomes a challenging task. The ability to continuously and accurately track the target object's position plays a vital role in mobility management. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization algorithm that fuses multiple signal features as the location fingerprints. The rationale that motivates our algorithm design stems from the following observation: although using one special signal feature (e.g., channel state information (CSI)) might achieve statistically higher accuracy than using another signal feature (e.g., received signal strength (RSS)), the accuracy for individual position estimations is usually diversified when only one signal feature is used in localization. For example, using RSS can obtain more accurate location estimation than using CSI for some individual positions. Thus, we propose a novel indoor localization algorithm that fuses multiple types of signal features as fingerprint of positions, which can effectively improve localization accuracy. We designed several fusion schemes and evaluated their performance. Experiments show that our algorithm achieves localization error below 0.5m and 1.1m in two typical indoor environments, about 30{\%} lower than the accuracy of algorithms by fusing multiple signal features. {\textcopyright} 2018 Yalong Xiao et al.},

abstract = {The position information of mobile users becomes the internal motivation to many locations based applications, such as indoor navigation, travel application and mobile advertising service. Fingerprinting-based indoor localization has been a hot topic in localization research in recent years due to its high accuracy, low complexity and low cost. This method, however, requires collecting a large number of reference point information in the offline training phase, which greatly limits its application in large environments. This paper proposes a new indoor localization algorithm based on multidimensional scaling (MDS), which utilizes the distance between two points' received signal strength vectors to approximately measure their distance in physical environment, and then calculates the target object's location with the distance constraints with MDS. We further propose a region refinement method to improve the localization accuracy, in which only reference points contained in a small rectangle that contains the estimated position of the target object are used to calculate the target's location. Experiment results in two real environments and large scale simulations demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. The results show that, compared with the Horus algorithm, the proposed algorithm can achieve similar or even higher accuracy and reduce the number of required reference points by almost one order of magnitude. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via large-scale simulation. {\textcopyright} 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.},

A BR line is fitted onto the points that have minimal BR values. Second, based on the property that illumination intensity at the points in a cast shadow area varies depending on their locations, illumination direction is estimated by modeling the height of the object, incident rays from the source of the illumination, and the BR line.

abstract = {Indoor localization is of importance for many applications. Crowdsourcing individual users' measurements can provide accurate localization without costly site-survey. However, crowdsourcing based approaches suffer from the cold start problem, in which at the beginning of system deployment, there are insufficient users to contribute their measurements, resulting in inaccurate and time-inefficient localization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid indoor localization method to solve such problem, called ACIL. We first employ the inertial navigation technique to localize some core positions or paths. To tackle the inaccuracy problem, we propose an effective method that utilizes the channel state information (CSI) of wireless signals for accurate distance estimation. This method is based on a new observation: there is a ripple-like fading pattern in wireless signals upon moving objects. Leveraging this observation, our system is capable of calculating the distance of human's movement and his/her direction. We also propose a graph-matching algorithm to setup the correlation between the trajectory and floor map. With those extra obtained location information, the impact of cold start issue will be significantly mitigated, while the LBS can be guaranteed with high localization accuracy. Extensive experiments show that the effectiveness in the human localization and movement detection. Extensive experiments validate the great performance of our protocol in case of various human locations and diverse channel conditions. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Indoor spaces accommodate large parts of people's life. The increasing availability of indoor positioning, driven by technologies like Wi-Fi, RFID, and Bluetooth, enables a variety of indoor location-based services (LBSs). Efficient indoor distance-aware queries on indoor moving objects play an important role in supporting and boosting such LBSs. However, the distance-aware query evaluation on indoor moving objects is challenging because: (1) indoor spaces are characterized by many special entities and thus render distance calculation very complex; (2) the limitations of indoor positioning technologies create inherent uncertainties in indoor moving objects data. In this paper, we propose a complete set of techniques for efficient distance-aware queries on indoor moving objects. We define and categorize the indoor distances in relation to indoor uncertain objects, and derive different distance bounds that can facilitate query evaluation. Existing works often assume indoor floor plans are static, and require extensive pre-computation on indoor topologies. In contrast, we design a composite index scheme that integrates indoor geometries, indoor topologies, as well as indoor uncertain objects, and thus supports indoor distance-aware queries efficiently without time-consuming and volatile distance computation. We design algorithms for range query and k nearest neighbor query on indoor moving objects. The results of extensive experimental studies demonstrate that our proposals are efficient and scalable in evaluating distance-aware queries over indoor moving objects. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {A novel indoor localization concept is introduced in this study. The navigating user takes an image inside a building to determine its own position. In the first step, this image is passed to a trained R-CNN that recognizes and localizes various types of objects in the image, such as doors, windows, signs, trash bins. Typically, the R-CNN output is a set of boxes representing the regions of the objects in the image, and their classification scores. The spatial relationships of these objects can be derived based on the box locations in the image and they can be represented as a directed graph, where the directions of the edges are the relationships, e.g., right-left, up-down. This graph is called image graph. The next step of the localization requires prior knowledge, basically the building model, obtained by blueprint or surveying, as the location of the used objects must be known. Assuming fixed positions, a graph can be derived similar to the image graph, but it is generated based on the building map. This graph is called position graph. Each unique position inside the building has its own position graph. Finally, the user location is obtained by measuring the similarity between the image graph and the stored position graphs. To prove the concept, a test was conducted in a typical yet challenging building. Images of selected objects were taken at randomly chosen locations around the test area. Correct solution was found in the 40.5{\%} of the cases with 5-10 m accuracy; the failure rate was 14.3{\%}; the rest 45.2{\%} produced multiple solutions. Note that the system is fail-safe at 85.7{\%}. The concept also allows deriving the direction of the image; the results suggest a 45-60° accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2017, Institute of Navigation.

abstract = {Compare with outdoor positioning, indoor positioning has been overlooked by many investigators. While GNSS can be made to work indoors, the lower signal levels and poor multipath environment mean that performance is much worse than outdoors, and in some places there is no coverage at all. Indoor GNSS and cell-phone bearer positioning will be in general use for emergency calls from mobiles (E911/E112), but with an accuracy close to 100 m (which is sufficient for this particular service). In contrast to the GPS, the DTV signals are received from transmitters at relatively short distance, while the broadcast transmitters operate at levels up to the megawatts effective radiated power (ERP). Also the RF frequency of the DTV signal is much lower than the GPS, which makes it easier for the signal to penetrate buildings and other objects. So it is suitable for the precision positioning inside the building and the city center. The digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTMB) is one of important standard about DTV, which is regulated by the national standard GB2006-20600. DTMB transmission system using time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS innovation OFDM) of single and multicarrier modulation. This modulation mainly for broadband transmission channel characteristics of terrestrial digital multimedia television broadcasting can achieve good performance in linear time-varying transmitter channel or frequency selective and time selective exist at the same time channel. Pseudorandom sequence (PN) is introduced in DTMB signal frame header, DTMB signal has more stronger correlation than other DTV standards. So DTMB is more suitable for precise indoor positioning. Integration of DTMB with GNSS can provide a seamless transition from outdoor to indoor position and vice-versa. The ranging accuracy expected from DTMB systems is expected to be better than 1m in severe multipath environments. The paper describes the concept of using the DTMB signal for indoor positioning and how it is proposed to ensure seamless operation with GNSS and crucial techniques of positioning system based on digital television terrestrial broadcasting is researched. Firstly, it proposal one acquisition and tracking method based on DTMB digital TV signal and the infrastructure of indoor positioning system based on DTMB is given. The operating principle of the indoor positioning system is very similar to that of a GNSS. Fixed terminals transmit accurately timed signals, along with information about the terminal's location and the transmission time. The handset has both GNSS and indoor DTMB receiving terminals, and uses either or both so that the positioning service is seamless. Secondly, it analyzes the DTMB system structure and signal frame structure, and takes an example as PN420 mode to research the relationship of signal frame head original function. PN sequence in DTMB signals should be used for position location and multipath estimation under some circumstances. However, large position location error may be introduced when there is co-channel interference in the DTMB signal. In the presence of co-channel interference, multipath estimation is actually the linear combination of the multipath channel responses from all the DTMB transmitters on the same channel, since an identical PN sequence is used for all co-channel DTMB transmitters. Thirdly, the receiver design in baseband is fulfilled by analyzing the operation principle of receiver and validated on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. Some key receiver techniques in baseband includes the digital filtering signal tracking, carrier tracking and code tracking, FIR filter and raise cosine filter is investigated. Based on some advantages of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Implementation of the receiver in baseband is used on FPGA hardware platform. Finally, the positioning result combined with the GNSS and the DTMB signal is achieved. The result is shown that the positioning combined with satellite navigation signal and the DTMB signal is precise in the complex city environments. It provides that combined positioning system with GNSS and digital television terrestrial broadcasting signal is realizable in complex circumstance of city.

abstract = {The demand for indoor navigation is increasingly urgent in many applications such as safe management of underground spaces or location services in complex indoor environment, e.g. shopping centres, airports, museums, underground parking lot and hospitals. Indoor navigation is still a challenging research field, as currently applied indoor navigation algorithms commonly ignore important environmental and human factors and therefore do not provide precise navigation. Flexible and detailed networks representing the connectivity of spaces and considering indoor objects such as furniture are very important to a precise navigation. In this paper we concentrate on indoor navigation considering obstacles represented as polygons. We introduce a specific space subdivision based on a simplified floor plan to build the indoor navigation network. The experiments demonstrate that we are able to navigate around the obstacles using the proposed network. Considering to well-known path-finding approaches based on Medial Axis Transform (MAT) or Visibility Graph (VG), the approach in this paper provides a quick subdivision of space and routes, which are compatible with the results of VG.},

abstract = {3D models are more powerful than 2D maps for indoor navigation in a complicate space like Hubei Provincial Museum because they can provide accurate descriptions of locations of indoor objects (e.g., doors, windows, tables) and context information of these objects. In addition, the 3D model is the preferred navigation environment by the user according to the survey. Therefore a 3D model based indoor navigation system is developed for Hubei Provincial Museum to guide the visitors of museum. The system consists of three layers: application, web service and navigation, which is built to support localization, navigation and visualization functions of the system. There are three main strengths of this system: it stores all data needed in one database and processes most calculations on the webserver which make the mobile client very lightweight, the network used for navigation is extracted semi-automatically and renewable, the graphic user interface (GUI), which is based on a game engine, has high performance of visualizing 3D model on a mobile display.},

However, finding the right object is a difficult task as the search should take into account not only the functionalities of the objects but also their physical localisation and their distance from the user. In this paper, a new approach to build a WOT search engine is introduced. A new semantic similarity is proposed to compare objects in ontology. To answer a user's request, the proposed model recommends objects according to both their geo-localisation and capabilities. Moreover, the search of objects takes into account the user's profile and expectations. The solution we proposed relies on fuzzy rule engines and a formal location model that characterise the search space in which relevant connected objects are selected.},

abstract = {In this paper, anisotropic scale space is introduced to SIFT method. The method will detect stable elliptical Gaussian blob features of different orientations. Additional feature parameters can be utilized to match features with high probability. New salient features are detected by convolving image with elliptical Gaussian instead circular one. The elliptical Gaussian pyramid is carefully constructed so as to balance elliptical coverage and computational complexity. The new method is tested with both images and videos, which range from indoor objects to outdoor scenes. The results show it can detect several times more salient features than SIFT with same feature quality. This new implementation is not significantly slower than SIFT, and the time complexity is linear with respect to the increased salient features. Multiprocessor or multicore system can be constructed as parallel computing environment, and the method will be as quick as SIFT. SIFT mainly uses descriptors to match, but frame information can also contribute to it. Although new parameters have been introduced, basic neighborhood information will be used to illustrate this idea. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Intensive work has already been done on vision‐based navigation of autonomous mobile robots. This paper proposes a new omnidirectional image sensor COPIS (COnic Projection Image Sensor) for guiding navigation of a mobile robot. In addition, a conic projection image sensor (COPIS) is described along with its application to estimate locations of static objects relative to the robot. The COPIS system acquires an omnidirectional view around the robot in real‐time by using a conic mirror. Its feature is passive sensing of the omnidirectional environment in real‐time using a conic mirror. Because the conic mirror is used, its image is under conic projection. Here, the azimuth of each point in the scene appears in the image as its direction from the image center. Under the assumption of constant motion of the robot, locations of objects around the robot can be estimated by detecting their azimuth changes in the omnidirectional image. Using this method, the robot generates an environmental map of an indoor scene while it is moving in the environment. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1991 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

By using neighborhoods, it is possible to determine whether the spatial relations between objects and their surrounding spatial information are strong. It can be said that a neighborhood is the spatial area of an object's attention, interest or concern. It is preferable that neighborhoods move while remaining centered on each respective moving object, avoiding walls as they expand through passable areas. Therefore, neighborhoods cannot be represented by a simple shape such as a rectangle or circle, and they must be calculated quickly in order to synchronize them with their respective objects' movements. We denote a method for rapidly generating potential fields by making use of the charge simulation method (CSM) and determine neighborhoods in consideration of the spatial structure from CSM.},

abstract = {Full-coverage synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging and human target identification in complex scenes are very important for security and rescue applications. In this paper, a drone-based vital-SAR-imaging hybrid radar system is proposed to realize targets' imaging and human identification simultaneously. Carried by an operational custom-built drone with a designed S-shaped trajectory, 2-D SAR images of the entire region could be obtained through the frequency-modulated continuous-wave mode, and the “vital Doppler” effect of human target can be searched through the Doppler mode. Then, the vital-SAR-imaging could be achieved. Several experiments including cart-based SAR imaging with three trajectories, cart-based vital-SAR-imaging, and drone-based multitrajectory vital-SAR-imaging were carried out to reveal the capability and distinct operational features of the proposed system. Experimental results demonstrate that the system has the ability to obtain SAR imaging results in different scenes with multiple trajectories, and the human target could be effectively distinguished from other stationary objects. The results show that the lowest human target location error is 0.06 m in a 4 m × 9 m indoor region, which illustrates the great potential for search and rescue applications.},

abstract = {Service systems used for various applications in home automation and security require estimating the locations precisely using certain sensors. Serving a mobile user automatically by sensing his/her locations in an indoor environment is considered as a challenge. However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the Global Positioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor environment has become popular. Some physical features have also been discussed to solve localization in WSNs. In this paper, we inquire into received signal strength indication (RSSI)-based solutions and propose a new localization scheme called the closer tracking algorithm (CTA) for indoor localization. Under the proposed CTA, a mechanism on mode-change is designed to switch automatically between the optimal approximately closer approach (ACA) and the real-time tracking (RTT) method according to pre-tuned thresholds. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to move reference nodes dynamically to reduce the uncovered area of the ACA for increasing the estimation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed CTA using ZigBee CC2431 modules. The experimental results show that the proposed CTA can determine the position accurately with an error distance less than 0.9 m. At the same time, the CTA scheme has at least 87{\%} precision when the distance is less than 0.9 m. The proposed CTA can select an adaptive mode properly to improve the localization accuracy with high confidence. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the accuracy can be improved by the deployment and movement of reference nodes. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a problem in robotics aiming to model the environment and estimate the pose of a device within it at the same time. Developed solution is the core technology for emerging applications such as self-driving cars, automated guided vehicles (AGV), and domestic robots. Inevitably, the performance of SLAM algorithms relies highly on input signals from optical equipment ranging from cameras, laser rangefinders, and LIDAR. Loop closure, the function detecting visited locations to correct accumulated errors, is a crucial element in a SLAM system. Conventionally, geometric features are used to interpret the scenes for similarity estimation. In scenarios with nearly identical scenes existing, the feature-based approaches remain ineffective. Semantic objects and the comparison of multi-frame, therefore, can be integrated into the process and present a new level of environmental information. In this article, we first provide an overview of the SLAM system. Then the semantic object-assisted and the time and spatial sequence comparison approach are proposed to improve the similarity measurement in the SLAM process. By integrating recognized objects like landmarks and signs, we can classify similar scenes better and significantly improve building-scale indoor mapping results. The performance of systems adopting various optical technologies is also compared in this work. {\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE.},

Instead of directly using RGB-D images, we first train and perform RefineNet model only using RGB information for generating the high-level semantic information. Then, the spatial location relationship from depth channel and the spectral information from color channels are integrated as a prior for a marker-controlled watershed algorithm to obtain the robust and accurate visual homogenous regions. Finally, higher-order Markov random field model encodes the short-range context among the adjacent pixels and the long-range context within each visual homogenous region for refining the semantic segmentations. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the public SUN RGB-D dataset.

abstract = {Indoor localization system using receive signal strength indicator from wireless access point has attracted lots of attention recently. Geometric method is one of the most widely used spatial graph algorithms to locate object in an indoor environment, but it does not achieve good results when it is applied to a limited amount of valid data, especially when using the trilateration method. On the other hand, localization based on fingerprint can achieve high accuracy but need to pay heavy manual labor for fingerprint database establishment. In this article, we propose a bilateral greed iteration localization method based on greedy algorithm in order to use all of the effective anchor points. Comparing to trilateration, fingerprint, and maximum-likelihood method, the bilateral greed iteration method improves the localization accuracy and reduces complexity of localization process. The method proposed, coupled with measurements in a real indoor environment, demonstrates its feasibility and suitability, since it outperforms trilateration and maximum-likelihood receive signal strength indicator–based indoor location methods without using any radio map information nor a complicated algorithm. Extensive experiment results in a Wi-Fi coverage office environment indicate that the proposed bilateral greed iteration method reduces the localization error, 63.55{\%}, 9.93{\%}, and 47.85{\%}, compared to trilateration, fingerprint, and maximum-likelihood method, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract = {Feature description for the 3D local shape in the presence of noise, varying mesh resolutions, clutter and occlusion is a quite challenging task in 3D computer vision. This paper tackles the problem by proposing a new local reference frame (LRF) together with a novel triple orthogonal local depth images (TOLDI) representation, forming the TOLDI method for local shape description. Compared with previous methods, TOLDI manages to perform efficient, distinctive and robust description for the 3D local surface simultaneously under various feature matching contexts. The proposed LRF differs from many prior ones in its calculation of the z-axis and x-axis, the z-axis is calculated using the normal of the keypoint and the x-axis is computed by aggregating the weighted projection vectors of the radius neighbors. TOLDI feature descriptors are then obtained by concatenating three local depth images (LDI) captured from three orthogonal view planes in the LRF into feature vectors. The performance of our TOLDI approach is rigorously evaluated on several public datasets, which contain three major surface matching scenarios, namely shape retrieval, object recognition and 3D registration. Experimental results and comparisons with the state-of-the-arts validate the effectiveness, robustness, high efficiency, and overall superiority of our method. Our method is also applied to aligning 3D object and indoor scene point clouds obtained by different devices (i.e., LiDAR and Kinect), the accurate outcomes further confirm the effectiveness of our method. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Point clouds of 3D scenes are widely applied in guiding the visually impaired by precious research. Many auxiliary systems for the visually impaired are integrated with RGB-D sensors such as Kinect and binocular cameras, which are able to acquire depth pictures and 3D point clouds. Real-time location of objects is adjusted to the world coordinate system through utilization of attitude angle transducers. This paper proposed a novel approach of scene segmentation based on the estimation of normal vectors of a point cloud. Multiplying a point cloud's normal vectors in two directions helps to eliminate correlation in different directions. It is used to split a stereo scene into several surfaces such as ground, walls and slopes. The method is faster and can obtain more separated results than RANSAC algorithm. Besides, three ways to evaluate surface smoothness are compared, including inconsistent degree of normal vectors, variance of depths and difference between normal vectors of two sizes of adjacent regions. Experimental results attained from indoor and outdoor circumstances are presented to validate the approach. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can be efficiently applied into scene segmentation and guiding the visually impaired.},

To fill the gap, Wi-Fi signal has grasped the great attention being purposed as the solution for Indoor Positioning System (IPS). Existing enormous efforts have been exerted to focus on the Wi-Fi fingerprinting to achieve high accuracy. Through deep learning and machine learning, the current Wi-Fi fingerprinting can localize the object with the accuracy better than GPS. Nonetheless, it involves huge labor-cost calibration and high training complexity for intensive site survey and requires recalibration for a different environment. Due to these limitations, the current approach using Wi-Fi fingerprinting is impractical as the indoor localization solution to present-day scientific and enterprise interest.

abstract = {Indoor positioning system is a rapidly emerging technology. Unlike outdoor positioning, which uses triangulation from satellites in line-of-sight, current indoor positioning methods attempt triangulation using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from indoor transmitters, like WiFi and RFID. These methods, however, are not accurate and suffer from issues like multi-path and absorption by walls and other objects. In this paper we propose an alternate and novel approach to indoor positioning, that combines signals from multiple sensors. In particular, we focus on visual and inertial sensors that are ubiquitously found in mobile devices. We utilize a Building Information Model (BIM) of the indoor environment as a guideline for navigable paths. The sensor suite signals are processed to generate a trajectory of device moving through the indoor environment. We compute features on this trajectory in real-time and data mine pre-computed features on BIM's navigable paths to determine the location of the device in real-time. We demonstrate our approach on BIM in our university campus. The key benefit of our approach is that unlike previous methods that require installation of a wireless sensor network of several transmitters spanning the indoor environment, we only require a floor-plan BIM and cheap ubiquitous sensor suite on board a mobile device for indoor positioning.},

The position measurement using IR-UWB radar uses at least two radars in the conventional algorithm, but assuming that the object is a point, the volume of the object is not considered at all. So it is impossible to predict where the real center of the body is located, and what kind of behavior it is, by only locating it by the reflection signal to the surface of the object. However, if we use the distance information of each of the four radars, we can measure the accurate position of the target and the direction of the target's body. We can also see what behavior patterns we have, and there is no privacy problem at all. In order to verify the proposed system, we installed a radar in four directions in the room and experimented with humans. We could track the position of the object and measure the direction of the body in real time. {\textcopyright} 2018 German Institute of Navigation - DGON.},

abstract = {A location-based service (LBS) cannot be realized unless solutions of the positioning problem are available at hand. For the outdoor positioning, GPS based practical solutions have been introduced. Using GPS they have developed so many commercial LBS systems. Navigation, logistics, troop management and fleet management are all examples of LBS. LBS is so useful that it should be available in doors. However, GPS signal is so weak inside buildings that we cannot determine the location of a moving object in doors with GPS only. Therefore, so many indoor positioning researches have been performed. Cricket, Active Badge and BAT are pioneers in the field of indoor positioning. They are very accurate but they require special equipments dedicated for positioning. Using special equipments is not economical. Therefore, many researchers have suggested using wireless local area networks (WLAN) in positioning. Among the methods they are using, the fingerprinting methods are most accurate. The deployment of the fingerprinting methods consists of two phases: the off-line phase and the on-line phase. During the off-line phase a site-survey of the received signal strength indices (RSSIs) from access points (APs) is performed. The vector of the RSSI values at a point is called the location fingerprint of that point. A lot of location fingerprints must be collected at each of the points in the site during the off-line phase. This is extremely tedious and time consuming. An alternative choice is the trilateration method. This method converts RSSIs from APs into distances and determines the location of the moving object with the distances and the locations of the APs. That is, we only need the coordinates of the APs in the site to get ready to run the trilateration positioning program. The conversion rule of RSSIs into distances is based on the RF propagation loss model. The model is a simple mathematical expression representing the relationship between the RSSI and the distance. However, the RSSI is influenced by obstructions, reflections and multipath and the RF propagation loss model is very erroneous. As a result, WLAN based trilateration is much less accurate than the fingerprinting method. Nevertheless, the trilateration method could be more practical than the fingerprinting method because it does not require the time consuming off-line phase process. Therefore, they established IEEE 802.15.4 A where the distance is determined by the speed of RF and TOF (Time of Flight). Ubi-nanoLOC mote complies with IEEE 802.15.4 A. This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the WLAN-based trilateration indoor positioning and the Ubi-nanoLOC indoor positioning draws our final conclusions.},

This paper presents an approach to analyzing indoor and outdoor coverage scopes of cell radio signals and recognizing locations and sources of intra-network interference in the network deployed in a dense urban environment. This approach takes scenario modeling to represent terrain and on-ground objects given by digital maps, utilizes ray tracing to track the signal propagation trajectories, and calculates strength attenuation of radio signals due to signal propagation such as direct transmission, reflection, diffraction and refraction. The uniform grid is employed as the acceleration structure to speed up tracing signal propagation paths, and drive-testing measurement data and scenario-oriented propagation model calibration are used to improve analysis accuracy. Weak coverage spots and interference defect spots are defined and used to identify interference types and sources.

Iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is one of the well-known methods for such purpose and often used for mobile robot SLAM. However, the algorithm is designed based on 'dense' (or 'continuous') measurement of the same space with known relative positions of measurement points and angles, and it does not often work efficiently if the measurement is sparse and/or LIDAR locations are unknown. Such situations are seen when some installed LIDARs in a room are used to build a background indoor map for object tracking, or mobile LIDARs are used by technicians to build a digital indoor map, where each space is captured only at a few locations with different angles. To tackle this issue, our method extracts line segments and edge points as features from given LIDAR point clouds and finds shape coincidences commonly contained in a pair of given point clouds to identify positional relationships between LIDARs. By this information, these point clouds can be integrated into common 2D coordinates. Indoor map generation is realized by sequentially applying this integration procedure to every pair of point clouds. Also, the experiments on real data show that our method can identify the relative positions of LIDARs with 10cm-order errors in average, and by sequentially applying the point-cloud integration, the generated maps have only 3{\%} errors. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

For an indoor context-aware smart space system, RFID tags and readers are utilized to locate object coordinates, cf. GPS utilizes GNSS for capture outdoor location information. Previous researches proposed to deploy regularly spaced reference tags, based on which the space location of target object tag can be estimated. Due to tag signal collision and received signal errors, the estimation accuracy is limited. We propose to utilize more than one RFID readers and control the reading power to eliminate estimation error. Passive tags that are cost effective are deployed for dense tag grid, e.g., for high accuracy location estimation. Experiments show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the estimation error from 69 cm to be under 15 cm. This RFID-based object location system can be applied to help people to locate personal belongings.

abstract = {In this paper, we consider chip-to-chip communication such as processor to memory link where the motherboard is placed in a casing similar to a desktop or a laptop. At THz frequencies, the dimensions of the casing are large enough that signal may reflect from the objects inside the box and the sides of the box creating resonant cavity effect. To model propagation in such an environment, we model casing as overmoded cavity and consider other objects in the casing as conductive objects. We propose a geometry-based statistical propagation model that describes chip-to-chip propagation in metal enclosures filled with conductive objects. Based on the geometrical model, a simulation model for multipath fading in this cavity is developed and correlation function is derived. The simulation results show that multiple reflections created in the resonant cavity significantly impact correlation function and power delay profile and need careful consideration when modeling chip-to-chip propagation in metal enclosures.},

In the Intelligent Space environment we can use laser range finders or ultrasonic positioning systems to localize and track mobile robots. Nevertheless, our final goal is to substitute these sensors and accomplish this task using just cameras. In this paper, we show the feasibility of determining the robot's location based on the images received from a single camera. In our experimental room we used a surveillance camera, which can be controlled to pan/tilt in order to change the point of view. The camera had been mounted on the ceiling and six preset positions were selected to cover the whole area. The object recognition is based on colour space filtering and contour detection. Finally, the contours of the detected objects are transformed from the image space to the world coordinate system and the polygons are reduced to simpler ones. The system is able to detect not only the position of the objects, but their orientations.},

abstract = {Teleoperation of complex environments from a remote place requires careful attention of the operator. In such environments as spacestations where operation errors will cause heavy damages, operators need to be well trained and experienced before practical teleoperation. Robot vision will help a lot in recognizing and locating objects in the environments. In such case, feature extraction is very important. Real time processing depends on quick and correct feature extraction of objects. If we place a man-made marker on an object, feature extraction will be much easier than directly extracting natural features of the object. We have developed a practical and robust method for object recognition and location using specially designed markers. Circle, rectangle and triangle are chosen as three primitives, and a marker is formed by combining any two of these primitives. Here primitive combination is used because it can both increase the number of markers without increasing primitives and distinguish markers from complex background. Edge information is mainly utilized in the process of object recognition because edges are relatively long and stable compared with corners. A marker is recognized by first recognizing each primitive in it and then determining their position relation. After recognition, back projective projection of a marker is taken and its 3D pose are calculated by solving spatial plane equations with the aid of parameters of each primitive in the marker such as diameters of a circle, equations of their images in the image plane. Extensive experiments have been done to verify effectiveness of the proposed method and quite good results are obtained for both indoor and outdoor environments, for both recognition and location of objects with markers.},

abstract = {Aiming at the low positioning accuracy of image space location in urban environments, this paper proposes a new method of space location of image in urban environments based on C/S structure. First, a series of indoor images are taken in advance. We use the nearest neighbor distance ratio (NNDR) and normalized cross correlation (NCC) to get the SIFT coarse matches, then use RANSAC method to optimize it, and calculate the fundamental matrix and projection matrix. Building 3D point cloud model is established, and the object space feature library including image feature points, image point coordinates and object space point coordinates are got. Second, we regard the building images which are taken by user's mobile phone as the location images. Image feature points of location images are extracted and matched with the feature points of object space feature library, then the object space point coordinates are obtained. Finally, we use collinearity equation model to accurately calculate the exterior orientation elements, and display the user's space position on the phone, thus space positioning is realized. The experimental results show that the positioning method in this paper can reach the centimeter level positioning accuracy, and can meet the requirements of the user positioning accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2018, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

abstract = {Traditional RF-based indoor positioning approaches use only Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to locate the target object. But RSSI suffers significantly from the multi-path phenomenon and other environmental factors. Hence, the localization accuracy drops dramatically in a large tracking field. To solve this problem, this paper introduces one more resource, the dynamic of RSSI, which is the variance of signal strength caused by the target object and is more robust to environment changes. By combining these two resources, we are able to greatly improve the accuracy and scalability of current RF-based approaches. We call such hybrid approach COCKTAIL. It employs both the technologies of active RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Sensors use the dynamic of RSSI to figure out a cluster of reference tags as candidates. The final target location is estimated by using the RSSI relationships between the target tag and candidate reference tags. Experiments show that COCKTAIL can reach a remarkable high degree of localization accuracy to 0.45m, which outperforms significantly to most of the pure RF-based localization approaches. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose WiBall, an accurate and calibration-free indoor tracking system that can work well in non-line-of-sight based on radio signals. WiBall leverages a stationary and location-independent property of the time-reversal focusing effect of radio signals for highly accurate moving distance estimation. Together with the direction estimation based on inertial measurement unit and location correction using the constraints from the floorplan, WiBall is shown to be able to track a moving object with decimeter-level accuracy in different environments. Since WiBall can accommodate a large number of users with only a single pair of devices, it is low-cost and easily scalable, and can be a promising candidate for future indoor tracking applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Collaborative Navigation (CN) is developed to provide an improvement on positioning performance for various navigation applications. This paper aims to investigate the CN technology in the way of object detection based on deep learning. A novel concept which integrates Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and digital cameras to achieve CN is presented in this paper. This approach utilizes a pre-Trained faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) to detect neighboring users from images. Then, by the image-based ranging approach proposed in this study, we obtain space ranges between users which would be tightly integrated with a local Kalman filter to provide IMU with error estimates. Unlike traditional location and ranging methods, this approach allows positioning solution to be performed in indoor environments, where radio frequency (RF) signal is generally blocked, reflected and attenuated by obstacles. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a test at the Ohio State University was implemented. The test results show that the ranging accuracy of image-based ranging approach stays around 1m at various range level. Also, bounding boxes with a higher score are more beneficial to achieve high ranging accuracy. The CP solution is able to drag the trajectory back to the ground truth and restricts the horizontal error to around 1m in an indoor area. {\textcopyright} 2017 Institute of Navigation.

Most of traditional loop closure detection approaches using hand-crafted features often lack robustness with respect to object occlusions and illumination changes, especially for the complicated indoor environment. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) makes a huge impact on many computer vision and pattern recognition applications. Depth images have complementary information to RGB images, which can encode the structural information of the scene. With the availability of inexpensive RGB-D sensors, it is expected that depth information can increase the accuracy in many computer vision applications. In this paper, we focus on indoor loop closure detection using the depth information. For the first time, we introduce a simple CNN model to train the depth images encoded by HHA method for indoor loop closure detection. The experiment demonstrates that HHA based CNN features can fully utilize the structural information of the scene, which shows that it is preferable than using raw depth images for loop closure detection. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

Although RSSI-based algorithms suffer from multipath effect and other environmental factors, reference tags and RSSI changes can be utilized to further improve the localization accuracy. However, the current algorithms lack deep analysis of the influence of tag interaction on localization accuracy and faces the challenge of simultaneously locating multiple close targets. In this paper, we propose an analysis method about how tag interaction affects a tag antenna radiation pattern and an RSSI change. The tag interaction analysis guides us to improve the design of RSSI-based localization algorithms. We take the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm and the Simplex algorithm as two examples. The experimental results show that the revised k-NN and the revised Simplex algorithms are robust to different numbers, spacing, and materials of target objects, and they are superior to other RFID localization schemes, considering cost, capability of simultaneous localization of multiple targets, and location estimation errors.},

Ultrasound shows promise to be exploited for a practical indoor location system due to its high accuracy ranging, low cost, safety, and imperceptibility. However, conventional ultrasonic location systems pose such challenges as high installation cost and manual calibration. The key idea of AUITS is to use only one autonomous device, Positioning on One Device (POD), to not only process signal acquisition but also conduct position computation. Structural topology is designed to make POD easily deployed and easily calibrated. In addition, a structural localization algorithm is proposed to provide an effective and affordable algorithm for POD to calculate the object's position. We describe the hardware prototype implementation of AUITS and evaluate its performance both experimentally and with simulation. The results show that the coverage area of a POD can reach 65 m2 and the positioning error is less than 15 cm with over 90{\%} probability. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Enterprises are paying more attention to warehouse management which has a pivotal role in enhancing productivity of the whole supply chain. As a key enabling technology for business intelligence(BI) applications, indoor positioning contributes to the object location awareness in warehouse management such as order picking and stock taking. In this work, we propose a new and cost-effective indoor positioning approach using iBeacon technology released by Apple, Inc. for warehouse management. Also, improved trilateration and fingerprinting algorithms are proposed for a real-life case of warehouse management. Our results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance of order picking and stock taking process in warehouse management with high accuracy.

abstract = {With the advances in wireless communication technologies and smart mobile devices, Location-based Services (LBS), which provide personalized services based on users' location information, have been widely applied in military, transportation, logistics etc. Currently, mainstream positioning techniques are mainly divided into three categories, including satellite-based positioning, network infrastructure-based positioning and presence sensing positioning. With the help of effective spatio-temporal indexes, LBS are capable of processing the service requests efficiently. LBS usually employ different location privacy preservation methods to protect the user privacy. Recently, because of the complexity of applications, the cooperation of multiple positioning techniques and the huge data volume, new challenges emerge. Indoor LBS, management of uncertain data, novel location privacy protection method, LBS on cloud infrastructure and social LBS are becoming critical issues. This paper introduces the architecture of an LBS system and the key techniques of its components. Second, After reviewing the main progresses in recent years, we discuss the future work briefly.},

abstract = {The lack of digital floor plans is a huge obstacle to pervasive indoor location based services (LBS). Recent floor plan construction work crowdsources mobile sensing data from smartphone users for scalability. However, they incur long time (e.g., weeks or months) and tremendous efforts in data collection. In this paper, we propose BatMapper, which explores a previously untapped sensing modality - acoustics - for fast, fine grained and low cost floor plan construction. We design sound signals suitable for heterogeneous microphones on commodity smartphones, and acoustic signal processing techniques to produce accurate distance measurements to nearby objects. We further develop robust probabilistic echo-object association, recursive outlier removal and probabilistic resampling algorithms to identify the correspondence between distances and objects, thus the geometry of corridors and rooms. We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Experiments in real buildings show BatMapper achieves 1-2 cm distance accuracy in ranges up around 4 m; a 2{\~{}}3 minute walk generates fine grained corridor shapes, detects doors at 92{\%} precision and 1{\~{}}2 m location error at 90-percentile; and tens of seconds of measurement gestures produce room geometry with errors {\textless}0.3 m at 80-percentile, at 1-2 orders of magnitude less data amounts and user efforts.},

This paper studies the localization performance in an indoor environment with an active RFID system. Three major localization methods, namely, multi-lateration, nearest-neighbor, and support vector machines (SVM) methods are implemented, and their results are compared. It shows that the SVM method outperforms the other two in terms of localization accuracy, but the three methods produce comparable localization precision values. For each method, observations and discussion are provided on how data sample size, beacon number, or neighbor number influences localization performance. In addition, time complexities of the three methods are compared. It is pointed out that, for practical applications, a balanced consideration of localization performance, method, hardware cost, and data collection effort is required for economical and yet satisfactory solutions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a 3-D-laser-based scene measurement technique and a novel place recognition method to deal with the random disturbances caused by unexpected movements of people and other objects. The proposed approach can extract and match the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURFs) from bearing-angle images generated by a self-built rotating 3-D laser scanner. It can cope with the irregular disturbance of moving objects and the problem of observing-location changes of the laser scanner. Both global metric information and local SURF features are extracted from 3-D laser point clouds and 2-D bearing-angle images, respectively. A large-scale indoor environment with over 1600 m2 and 30 offices is selected as a testing site, and a mobile robot, i.e., SmartROB2, is deployed for conducting experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed 3-D-laser-based scene measurement technique and place recognition approach are effective and provide robust performance of place recognition in a dynamic indoor environment.},

abstract = {This paper mainly studies the indoor scene cognition problem for mobile robots. The structure of an indoor scene is assumed to be structured, while indoor objects are in a variety of forms, which are difficult to be represented by specific descriptive models. In our work, planes are extracted from 3D laser data using regional expansion algorithm, and the properties as well as the relationship of these planes are used for the indoor structure identification. In order to adopt digital image processing algorithm to implement object detection, a bearing angle model is used to represent laser point clouds, so that 3D laser scanning data can be converted to 2D bearing angle image. It is difficult to detect a large number of different classes of objects in cluttered indoor scenes, especially when the mobile robot acquires the 3D laser scanning data in different locations and angles of view. An approach based on gentleboost algorithm is proposed for multi-class object detection, which takes the fragments and the location with respect to the object center as the generic features for object detection. As the result of indoor structure identification, the specific region for ceiling, floor, wall and door can be labeled in the bearing angle image. With the help of known semantic information, the false object detection results can be eliminated effectively. Experiment results implemented on a real mobile robot show the validity of the proposed method. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 Acta Automatica Sinica. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The reliable automatic visual recognition of indoor scenes with complex object constellations using only sensor data is a nontrivial problem. In order to improve the construction of an accurate semantic 3D model of an indoor scene, we exploit human-produced verbal descriptions of the relative location of pairs of objects. This requires the ability to deal with different spatial reference frames (RF) that humans use interchangeably. In German, both the intrinsic and relative RF are used frequently, which often leads to ambiguities in referential communication. We assume that there are certain regularities that help in specific contexts. In a first experiment, we investigated how speakers of German describe spatial relationships between different pieces of furniture. This gave us important information about the distribution of the RFs used for furniture-predicate combinations, and by implication also about the preferred spatial predicate. The results of this experiment are compiled into a computational model that extracts partial orderings of spatial arrangements between furniture items from verbal descriptions. In the implemented system, the visual scene is initially scanned by a 3D camera system. From the 3D point cloud, we extract point clusters that suggest the presence of certain furniture objects. We then integrate the partial orderings extracted from the verbal utterances incrementally and cumulatively with the estimated probabilities about the identity and location of objects in the scene, and also estimate the probable orientation of the objects. This allows the system to significantly improve both the accuracy and richness of its visual scene representation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown their great success on image classification. CNNs mainly consist of convolutional and pooling layers, both of which are performed on local image areas without considering the dependence among different image regions. However, such dependence is very important for generating explicit image representation. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well known for their ability of encoding contextual information in sequential data, and they only require a limited number of network parameters. Thus, we proposed the hierarchical RNNs (HRNNs) to encode the contextual dependence in image representation. In HRNNs, each RNN layer focuses on modeling spatial dependence among image regions from the same scale but different locations. While the cross RNN scale connections target on modeling scale dependencies among regions from the same location but different scales. Specifically, we propose two RNN models: 1) hierarchical simple recurrent network (HSRN), which is fast and has low computational cost and 2) hierarchical long-short term memory recurrent network, which performs better than HSRN with the price of higher computational cost. In this paper, we integrate CNNs with HRNNs, and develop end-to-end convolutional hierarchical RNNs (C-HRNNs) for image classification. C-HRNNs not only utilize the discriminative representation power of CNNs, but also utilize the contextual dependence learning ability of our HRNNs. On four of the most challenging object/scene image classification benchmarks, our C-HRNNs achieve the state-of-the-art results on Places 205, SUN 397, and MIT indoor, and the competitive results on ILSVRC 2012. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Localization in wireless sensor networks is an important functionality that is required for tracking personnel and assets in industrial environments, especially for emergency response. Current commercial localization systems such as GPS suffer from the limitations of either high cost or low availability in many situations (e.g., indoor environments that exclude direct line-of-sight signal reception). The development of industrial wireless sensor networks such as WirelessHART provides an alternative. In this article, we present the design and implementation of ColLoc: a collaborative location and tracking system on WirelessHART as an industrially viable solution. This solution is built upon several technological advances. First, ColLoc adds the roaming functionality to WirelessHART and thus provides a means for keeping mobile WirelessHART devices connected to the network. Second, ColLoc employs a collaborative framework to integrate different types of distance measurements into the location estimation algorithm by weighing them according to their precision levels. ColLoc adopts several novel techniques to improve distance estimation accuracy and decreases the RSSI presurvey cost. These techniques include introducing distance error range constraints to the measurements, judiciously selecting the initial point in location estimation and online updating the signal propagationmodels in the anchor nodes, integrating Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with trilateration to track moving objects. Our implementation of ColLoc can be applied to any WirelessHART-conforming network because no modification is needed on the WirelessHART field devices. We have implemented a complete ColLoc system to validate both the design and the effectiveness of our localization algorithm. Our experiments show that the mobile device never drops out of the WirelessHART network while moving around; with the help of even one dependable anchor, using RSSI can yield at least 75{\%} of distance errors below 5 meters, which is quite acceptable for many typical industrial automation applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

Unlike other approaches, which tend to manually define the knowledge of the robot, our approach enables robots to actively query the World Wide Web (WWW) to learn background knowledge about the physical environment. We show that our approach is able to search the Web to infer the probability that an object, such as a "coffee," can be found in a location, such as a "kitchen." Our approach, called ObjectEval, is able to dynamically instantiate a utility function using this probability, enabling robots to find arbitrary objects in indoor environments. Our experimental results show that the interactive version of ObjectEval visits 28{\%} fewer locations than the version trained offline and 71{\%} fewer locations than a baseline approach which uses no background knowledge.

abstract = {Indoor tracking systems have become very popular, wherein pedestrian movement is analyzed in a variety of commercial and secure spaces. The inertial sensor-based method makes great contributions to continuous and seamless indoor pedestrian tracking. However, such a system is vulnerable to the cumulative locating errors when moving distance increases. Inaccurate heading values caused by the interference of body swing of natural walking and the geomagnetic disturbances are the main sources of the accumulative errors. To reduce such errors, additional infrastructure or highly accurate sensors have been used by previous works that considerably raise the complexity of the architecture. This paper presents an indoor pedestrian tracking system called WTrack, using only geomagnetic sensors and acceleration sensors that are commonly carried by smartphones. A fine-grained walk pattern of indoor pedestrians is modeled through Hidden Markov Model. With this model, WTrack can track indoor pedestrians by continuously recognizing the pre-defined pedestrians' walk pattern. More importantly, WTrack is able to resist both the interference of body swing of natural walking and the geomagnetic disturbances of nearby objects. Our experimental results reveal that the location error is {\textless}2 m, which is considered adequate for indoor location-based-service applications. The adaptive sample rate adjustment mode further reduces the energy consumption by 52 {\%} in comparison, as opposed to the constant sampling mode. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that robots can model their world with Multi-Level (ML) maps, which utilize patches in a two-dimensional grid space to represent various environment elevations within a given grid cell. Although these maps are able to produce three-dimensional models of the environment while exploiting the computational feasibility of single elevation maps, they do not take into account in-plane uncertainty when matching measurements to grid cells or when grouping those measurements into patches. To respond to these drawbacks, this paper proposes to extend these ML maps into Probabilistic Multi-Level (PML) maps, which use formal probability theory to incorporate estimation and modeling errors due to uncertainty. Measurements are probabilistically associated with cells near the nominal location, and are categorized through hypothesis testing into patches via classification methods that incorporate uncertainty. Experimental results on representative objects found in both indoor and outdoor environments show that PML generally outperforms ML, including in noisy and sparse data environments, by producing more consistent, informative and conservative maps. In addition, PML provides the framework to heterogeneous, cooperative mapping and a way to probabilistically discriminate between conflicting maps. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2011.},

A Number of real world applications such as airport passenger baggage tracking have adapted RFID as a main technological tool for tracking and monitoring. However, the data generated by the RFID tracking contains errors. Therefore, it is important to remove such errors before data is used for any business processing. The primary focus of this paper is object bouncing problem, which happens when the object with attached RFID tag is detected by two or more RFID readers simultaneously or within a short period of time. Due to the bouncing, object appears to go back and forth between several locations in very short time, which is not realistically possible. To cater bouncing problem we exploit the reach-ability time constraints implied by the deployed readers in an indoor space. We evaluate the proposed work using the synthetically generated RFID data. The results shows that the approach is effective and efficient. {\textcopyright} 2017 ACM.},

We present an approach to indoor localization and pose estimation in order to support augmented reality applications on a mobile phone platform. Using the embedded camera, the application localizes the device in a familiar environment and determines its orientation. Once the 6 DOF pose is determined, 3D virtual objects from a database can be projected into the image and displayed for the mobile user. Off-line data acquisition consists of acquiring images at different locations in the environment. The online pose estimation is done by a featurebased matching between the cell phone image and an image selected from the precomputed database using the phone's sensors (accelerometer and magnetometer). The application enables the user both to visualize virtual objects in the camera image and to localize the user in a familiar environment. We describe in detail the process of building the database and the pose estimation algorithm used on the mobile phone. We evaluate the algorithm performance as well as its accuracy in terms of reprojection distance of the 3D virtual objects in the cell phone image. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Low-power and low-cost devices are expected to create a network of interconnected smart objects able to transform our homes into real Smart Homes. However, the heterogeneity of the underlying technologies prevents these smart objects to natively interoperate for adapting the environment to users' needs. In addition, common users are often excluded from the development of new applicative services that exploit physical devices, as they do not have sufficient programming and technological skills. To overcome these limitations, we propose a software ecosystem that allows different-skilled users to develop location-aware services able to autonomously manage the Smart Home. These services control the environment in accordance with user-defined rules and the users' location, calculated by exploiting an indoor localization mechanism. In addition, to directly interact with smart devices, users can also define customized interfaces for mobile devices. Finally, a multi-protocol middleware allows both the services and the mobile applications to access the physical network hiding the underlying heterogeneities. As a proof-of-concept, the first implementation steps are presented. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the last years, techniques for activity recognition have attracted increasing attention. Among many applications, a special interest is in the pervasive e-Health domain where automatic activity recognition is used in rehabilitation systems, chronic disease management, monitoring of the elderly, as well as in personal well being applications. Research in this field has mainly adopted techniques based on supervised learning algorithms to recognize activities based on contextual conditions (e.g., location, surrounding environment, used objects) and data retrieved from body-worn sensors. Since these systems rely on a sufficiently large amount of training data which is hard to collect, scalability with respect to the number of considered activities and contextual data is a major issue. In this paper, we propose the use of ontologies and ontological reasoning combined with statistical inferencing to address this problem. Our technique relies on the use of semantic relationships that express the feasibility of performing a given activity in a given context. The proposed technique neither increases the obtrusiveness of the statistical activity recognition system, nor introduces significant computational overhead to real-time activity recognition. The results of extensive experiments with data collected from sensors worn by a group of volunteers performing activities both indoor and outdoor show the superiority of the combined technique with respect to a solely statistical approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically investigates the integration of statistical and ontological reasoning for activity recognition. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

In contrast to previous work that relies on specialized image capture, user input, and/or simple scene models, we train an end-to-end deep neural network that directly regresses a limited field-of-view photo to HDR illumination, without strong assumptions on scene geometry, material properties, or lighting. We show that this can be accomplished in a three step process: 1) we train a robust lighting classifier to automatically annotate the location of light sources in a large dataset of LDR environment maps, 2) we use these annotations to train a deep neural network that predicts the location of lights in a scene from a single limited field-of-view photo, and 3) we fine-tune this network using a small dataset of HDR environment maps to predict light intensities. This allows us to automatically recover high-quality HDR illumination estimates that significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, using our illumination estimates for applications like 3D object insertion, produces photo-realistic results that we validate via a perceptual user study. {\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

EnHANTs will enable the Internet of Things by providing the infrastructure for various novel tracking applications. Examples of these applications include locating misplaced items, continuous monitoring of objects, and determining locations of disaster survivors. Recent advances in ultra-low-power circuit design, ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communications, and organic energy harvesting techniques will enable the realization of EnHANTs in the near future. The harvesting components and the ultra-low-power physical layer have special characteristics whose implications on the higher layers have yet to be studied (e.g., when using UWB communications, the energy required to receive a bit is significantly higher than the energy required to transmit a bit).

abstract = {During the last 10 years, many modern IT-based applications have developed inside buildings. Many of those applications would benefit by the ability to locate people and/or objects inside the building (indoor positioning). However, most of today's indoor positioning systems are not able to deliver precise position information ({\textless}10 cm) along with quality parameters. Ultra wide band (UWB) is a new radio-based technology that allows the determination of distances in indoor environments with a very high spatial resolution even through building materials. At the Institute of Geodesy of TU Darmstadt, a high-resolution UWB positioning system (UWB-ILPS; ILPS, indoor local positioning systems) based on trilateration principle has been developed to estimate the position of a mobile station precisely. To benefit from knowing the position and orientation, it is necessary to select and merge data linked to the user's location for indoor location services. By this means, the visitor to a public building may benefit from the system as his position is shown on a digital floor plan generated dynamically or by retrieving location-based information inside the building. Mixed reality systems also offer advantages for a mobile building information system. For this purpose, a webcam was replaced by the digital camera in the UWB-ILPS prototype. Knowing the camera's location in space and its view direction, one is able to merge the real world taken by the webcam with the virtual world represented by a 3D CAD model of the building. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {We present an automatic spatial-segmentation method for a novel magnetic-field hybrid indoor positioning system. Unlike conventional approaches that implement magnetic field alone for the whole experimental space, our approach employs an efficient automatic segmentation method to make up the constraints of magnetic-field indoor positioning after fully evaluating local magnetic-field characteristics. By generating new partitioned databases, this method takes full advantage of characteristic changes in the geomagnetic field according to the distribution of disturbance objects inside buildings. Moreover, it reduces the processing time, as new databases contribute only to the region partition, and no further location calculation is involved. Experimental evaluations carried out with two different sets of hybrid techniques confirm satisfactory performance of the indoor localisation based on automatic spatial segmentation achieving more than a 1 meters' improvement in the average error distance compared to conventional magnetic-field localisation systems. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

The architecture of RBFNN is selected via a minimization of the Localized Generalization Error (L-GEM) which selects RBFNN with better generalization ability to unseen samples. Virtual reference tags are adopted to improve positioning performance without additional cost and RF interference. A nonlinear interpolation algorithm is proposed to calculate Received Signal Strength (RSS) for Virtual reference tags which is more reasonable than linear interpolation algorithm.

In the image analysis stage, we obtain the object information from the input image using geometric reasoning technology combined with an image segmentation method. In the model retrieval stage, line drawings are extracted from 2D objects and 3D models by using different line rendering methods. We exploit various tokens to represent local features and then organize them together as a star-graph to show a global description. By comparing similarity among the encoded line drawings, models are retrieved from the model library. Also, for a better user experience, we add a relevance feedback stage following the retrieval stage. The Support Vector Machine method is used to conduct the feedback operation. After this stage, the retrieved models are in conformance with the image semantic. The 3D scene is then reconstructed.

Previous approaches in WiFi-based indoor localization and tracking either assume prior knowledge of indoor environment or assume many data samples from location-fixed WiFi sources (i.e. anchor points). However, such assumptions are not always true, especially in emergency scenarios. This paper explores the possibility of real-time indoor localization and tracking without any knowledge of indoor environment and with real-time data samples from only few anchor points outside the building. By using a small set of synchronized directional antennas as outdoor anchor points to actively scan in various directions, a moving device inside the building can be localized and tracked from the received signal in real-time manner. The paper proposes an angle-of-arrival estimator for accurate localization and adaptive per-antenna angular scheduling for real-time indoor tracking. The validation results from real experiment and simulation yield effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed schemes. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

In this paper, we address the challenge of localization and retrieval of objects in cluttered environments using passive RFID tags, by developing a novel indoor path loss translational model that considers the signal properties across the clutter. The proposed InPLaCE RFID system estimates the position of the object within a clutter by employing a robust translation model that accounts for the properties of the clutter and helps compensate for estimation errors over existing path loss models. Our experiments over different cluttered environments show that the proposed translational model improves the localization accuracy of objects over existing path loss models. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

In this effort, we present an alternate method of detecting frontiers during the course of robot motion that circumvents the requirement of dense mapping. Based on the observation that frontiers typically occur around areas with sudden change in texture (zero-crossings), we propose a novel linear chain Conditional Random Field(CRF) formulation that is able to detect the presence or absence of frontier regions around such areas. We use cues like spread of 3D points and scene change around these areas as an observation to CRF. We demonstrate that this method gives us more relevant frontiers compared to other monocular camera based methods in the literature. Finally, we present results in an indoor environment, wherein frontiers are reliably detected around walls leading to new corridors, doors leading to new rooms or corridors and tables and other objects that open up to a new space in rooms. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

Based on tags pattern, algebraic approach could solve the 2D trajectory tracking problem. However, the tracking accuracy of this approach is highly related to the tags position distribution and position unit. It would be inaccurate for some erratic trajectory tracking. Thus, we would try to apply and evaluate the probabilistic approaches, such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), into RFID tag based trajectory tracking. In this paper, we propose an RFID tag based SLAM algorithm for 2D trajectory tracking. Also a technique called Map adjustment is proposed to increase the efficiency of the algorithm.

We have developed this method by using a complementary combination of 1) received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) and vibration data acquired from active RFID tags, and 2) human behavior detected from various types of sensors embedded in the environment. Regarding the former, we use a pattern recognition method to select a feature appeared in SSIs received by several radio frequency (RF) readers at different places and to classify them into a particular location. In our work, we regard the estimated location as the most probable location where the object is placed. As for the latter, we use the detected human behavior to support the estimation based on the analysis of RSSIs. Experiment results showed that the proposed method improved the estimation performance from about 50 to 95{\%} compared with using only RSSIs to localize objects. Moreover, the results also suggested that we can estimate object location indoors without sensors for detecting human position.

abstract = {The representation and recognition of complex semantic events (e.g. illegal parking, stealing objects) is a challenging task for high-level understanding of video sequence. To solve this problem, an attribute graph grammar for events modeling is studied in this paper. This grammar models the variability of semantic events by a set of meaningful "event components" with the spatio-temporal constraints. The event components are defined manually according to their semantic meaning, and further decomposed into atomic event primitives. These event primitives are learned on a object-trajectory table that describes mobile object attributes (location, velocity, and visibility) in a video sequence. A dictionary of temporal and spatial relations are defined to constrain the event primitives. With this representation, one observed event can be parsed into an "event parse graph", and all possible variability of one event can be modeled into an "event And-Or graph", in a syntactic way. The probability model of an "event And-Or graph" can be learned on a set of annotated event instances, and given a learned event And-Or graph, a Gibbs sampling scheme is utilized for inference on a testing video. In the experiments, we test events recognition performance of the proposed on both real indoor and outdoor videos and show quantitative recognition rate on the public LHI dataset. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Usage areas of mobile phones have increased in the last 10 years. Although there have been improvements in many areas, most of the developments are in the field of positioning systems. Although the people's lives continue in indoor environments, location-based information system receives data from the satellites, which can detect a person's location in outdoor areas. In indoor areas, satellite signals can cause false information or can be interrupted by the objects in the area. In this study, an indoor navigation system has been designed and developed that only uses the accelerometer, the camera and the compass components on the phone and does not require satellite signals for positioning. To provide independence from the map in this application, augmented reality is applied during the routing process by utilizing built-in camera of the phone and no map is used. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Femto-cells can improve user experience in indoor locations, and increase overall system capacity with modest monetary investment. But the unplanned dynamic nature of these cells, significantly complicate resource allocation and interference control. We propose a relatively simple, decentralised market-oriented scheme for sub-channel and power allocation when femto-cell users co-exist with those of an OFDMA macro-cell. Our scheme utilises the Dutch auction (price progressively falls until a participant buys the object). Special "confirmation messages" are used to control interference, achieve channel reuse across Femto-cells, and mitigate the "hidden terminal" problem. Secure software inside each terminal may record transactions for eventual payment collection, or the auction can be interpreted as a prioritised decentralised allocation algorithm, without real money exchange.

abstract = {Precise indoor localization is of great importance to automatically track people or objects indoors and plays a vital role in modern life. Despite a number of innovative research present in the literature indoor localization still remains an open problem. To trace the main reason we identify that in the present literature the tendency is to pinpoint the exact coordinates of a target device although most of the location based services (LBSs) do not require exact coordinates. To support LBS, one can simply divide the area of interest into several zones and perform ''zone-fencing'', i.e., find under which zone the user is currently located at. In this paper, we propose a zone-based indoor localization scheme using neural networks. With the results from real world indoor settings, we show that a number of empty clusters is generated when the traditional counter propagation network (CPN) is applied as is. But a slight modification to the CPN reduces the number of empty clusters significantly and provides promising accuracy. The proposed scheme outperforms "k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm" (k-NN) and its promising accuracy makes it suitable for real-world deployment. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Indoor localization and mapping has become very crucial part of pervasive computing in recent times. Conventional outdoor techniques using GPS, Wi-Fi, and Cellular Networks have proved expensive and unconventional for indoor mapping. This document presents unique method of real time indoor localization and mapping using FM and ASK wave transceivers implemented using Phased Locked Loop and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Localization is procured with respect to three FM transmitters tuned at different frequencies. The geometrical wave model of these transmitters renders family of circles, where radius of each circle represents 'Received Signal Strength Indicator' (RSSI) value corresponding to a particular transmitter. Solving this family of circles for a common point yields the location of object with respect to the transmitters. Object is installed with customized FPGA core and 3 FM receivers tuned to respective transmitter frequencies. RSSI values from each FM receiver are resolved into 4 bit digital values inclusively. FPGA acquire and process values from FM receivers via 3 parallel I2C buses which provide real time response. Unwanted continuous FM radiation is prevented by the use of wireless control over FM transmitters. Overall, a low cost solution is obtained to create a digital map which localizes and tracks objects in real-time. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Several techniques have been developed for recovering reflectance properties of real surfaces under unknown illumination. However, in most cases, those techniques assume that the light sources are located at inifinity, which cannot be applied safely to, for example, reflectance modeling of indoor environments. In this paper, we propose two types of methods to estimate the surface reflectance property of an object, as well as the position of a light source from a single view without the distant illumination assumption, thus relaxing the conditions in the previous methods. Given a real image and a 3D geometric model of an object with specular reflection as inputs, the first method estimates the light source position by fitting to the Lambertian diffuse component, while separating the specular and diffuse components by using an iterative relaxation scheme. Our second method extends that first method by using as input a specular component image, which is acquired by analyzing multiple polarization images taken from a single view, thus removing its constraints on the diffuse reflectance property. This method simultaneously recovers the reflectance properties and the light source positions by optimizing the linearity of a log-transformed Torrance-Sparrow model. By estimating the object's reflectance property and the light source position, we can freely generate synthetic images of the target object under arbitrary lighting conditions with not only source direction modification but also source-surface distance modification. Experimental results show the accuracy of our estimation framework. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Although geolocation can be considered as a mature field, there is an ongoing research in the area of microlocation. Despite that, microlocation techniques do not offer satisfactory level of accuracy and implementation flexibility to be practically incorporated into commercial solutions. This is mainly because of high workload that needs to be done in terms of maps preparation and algorithms tuning.

Physical location of user is important to context-aware pervasive application providers. RFID is one of the most widely adopted wireless positioning technologies. Compared to other wireless technologies, e.g. GPS and WLAN, RFID is particularly suitable for indoor positioning. Existing methods usually assume a constant environment for the application field. However, this may not be true in many cases. For example, warehouse may have different goods yielding different interference to RFID signal in different days. This paper proposes a new method to estimate locations of objects based on RFID. The indoor positioning with RFID reader based on the received signal strength and passive UHF tags as reference tags. A Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained via a minimization of the Localized Generalization Error (L-GEM) is adopted to learn the object location based on received RFID signals. The L-GEM provides an estimate on the generalization capability of the RBFNN which is important to locate future unseen samples correctly in different yet similar environments. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing RFID based indoor positioning method. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

While when a moving object comes into an enclosed area, GPS signal will be limited. For this paper, we propose a new indoor positioning model which aims to achieve cm-level indoor location by using CPM method. One of the most important parts of this model is to extract the most accurate carrier phase values from the tracking loop in receivers, thus the affection and performance of the carrier tracking loop will be firstly analyzed. The discriminator function is achieved by CORDIC algorithm based on hardware platform instead of traditional look-up-table method. The result shows that with the increasing iterations, carrier phase error can reach to 10-7 rad which equals to the distance of 10-6cm and it has little impact on PVT. On the other hand, CORDIC algorithm saves hardware resources as well as has faster speed to process tracking loop. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Indoor radio frequency tracking systems are generally quite expensive and can vary in accuracy due to interference, equipment quality or other environmental factors. Due to these limiting factors of the technology, many businesses today find it hard to justify investing in RFID tracking technologies to improve the safety, efficiency and security of their working environments. The aim of this project was to provide a budget RFID tracking system that was capable of tracking a person or object through an indoor environment. To minimize the cost of the RFID tracking system, the components of the system were built from existing electronic equipment and hardware. The software was also written to minimize licensing and support fees allowing a cost effective budget RFID tracking system to be developed. The tracking system consists of a tag, reader nodes and a PC reader which utilize synapse RF 100 engines with python scripts embedded on to the chips. The tracking system software operates through a web portal utilizing web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript and PHP to allow the tags location to be represented on a two dimensional map using scalable vector graphics. During development of the system a new trilateration algorithm was developed and used convert the signals received from the tag to a virtual position on the map correlating to the actual physical position of the tag. A unique contribution of this system is the low cost of building which we estimate as less than €200 UK sterling for a five node system. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract = {Self-localization is the process of knowing your position and location relative to your surroundings. This research integrated artificial intelligence techniques into a custom-built portable eye tracker for the purpose of automating the process of determining indoor self-localization. Participants wore the eye tracker and walked a series of corridors while a video of the scene was recorded along with fixation locations. Patches of the scene video without fixation information were used to train the classifier by creating feature maps of the corridors. For testing the classifier, fixation locations in the scene were extracted and used to determine the location of the participant. Scene patches surrounding fixations were used for the classification instead of objects in the environment. This eliminated the need for complex computer vision object recognition algorithms and made scene classification less dependent upon objects and their placement in the environment. This allowed for a sparse representation of the scene since image processing to detect and recognize objects was not necessary to determine location. Experimentally, image patches surrounding fixations were found to be a highly reliable indicator of location, as compared to random image patches, non-fixated salient image patches, or other non-salient scene locations. In some cases, only a single fixation was needed to accurately identify the correct location of the participant. To the best of our knowledge, this technique has not been used before for determining human self-localization in either indoor or outdoor settings. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

Rao-Blackwellised particle filters are used to estimate object locations. Each particle represents the association history between Kalman filtered object tracks and observations. After using only anonymous sensors until id estimates are certain enough, id assignments are sampled as well resulting in a fully Rao-Blackwellised particle filter over both object tracks and id assignments.

abstract = {For supporting location-aware computing in indoor environments, the location sensing/positioning system not only need to provide objects' precise location, but also should own such characteristics as: isotropy and convenience for portability. In this paper, we present an indoor location sensing system, Cicada. This System is based on the TDOA (time difference of arrival) between Radiofrequency and ultrasound to estimate distance, and adopts a technology integrating Slide Window Filter (SWF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to calculate location. Consequently, it not only can determine the coordinate location within 5cm average deviation either for static objects or for mobile objects, but also owns a nearly omni-directional working area. Moreover, it is able to run independently, mini and light so that it is very easy to be portable and even embedded into people's paraphernalia. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

In our system, each camera is connected to a dedicated computer on which foreground regions in the camera image are detected. This is done using an adaptive background model. These detected foreground regions are broadcasted to a tracking agent, which computes believed 3D locations of persons based on the detected image regions. We have implemented both a best-hypothesis heuristic tracking approach as well as a probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker to find the object tracks from these 3D locations. The two tracking approaches are evaluated on a sequence of two people walking in a conference room recorded with three cameras. The results suggest that the probabilistic tracker shows comparable performance to the heuristic tracker. {\textcopyright} 2002 IEEE.},

This paper presents a new algorithm for automatic object extraction with the help of a shape repository, which is an effective approach applicable to 3D meshes without scene graphs. In the new algorithm, connected components are first computed and taken as initial clusters. Then, based on the global shape similarities between the supposed mergence of two shapes and any shape from the shape repository, we make a decision as to whether two close shapes should be merged or not. Our iterative merging scheme is performed until none of the close shapes can be merged. Experiments show that this method is very efficient on some indoor scenes. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Although the use of computer vision to analyse images from smartphones is in its infancy, the opportunity to exploit these devices for various assistive applications is beginning to emerge. In this paper, we consider two potential applications of computer vision in the assistive context for blind and partially sighted users. These two applications are intended to help provide answers to the questions of "Where am I?" and "What am I holding?". First, we suggest how to go about providing estimates of the indoor location of a user through queries submitted by a smartphone camera against a database of visual paths - descriptions of the visual appearance of common journeys that might be taken. Our proposal is that such journeys could be harvested from, for example, sighted volunteers. Initial tests using bootstrap statistics do indeed suggest that there is sufficient information within such visual path data to provide indications of: a) along which of several routes a user might be navigating; b) where along a particular path they might be. We will also discuss a pilot benchmarking database and test set for answering the second question of "What am I holding?". We evaluated the role of video sequences, rather than individual images, in such a query context, and suggest how the extra information provided by temporal structure could significantly improve the reliability of search results, an important consideration for assistive applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Signal decay is the fundamental problem of wireless communications, especially in an indoor environment where line-of-sight (LOS) paths for signal propagation are often blocked and various indoor objects exacerbate signal fading. There are three reasons for signal decay: long transmission distance, signal penetration, and reflection. In this paper, we propose OptRe which optimally places metallic reflectors - providing a highly reflective surface that can reflect impinging signals almost 100{\%} - in indoor environments to reduce the reflection loss and enhance wireless transmissions. It enhances both WiFi signal and low-power IoT devices without changing their configurations or network protocols. To enable OptRe, we first develop an empirical signal propagation model that can accurately estimate the signal strength and adapt itself to the reflectors' location. Using micro-benchmarks, our empirical signal propagation model is shown to be more accurate than the other existing path loss models. We also optimally place reflectors to maximize the worst-case signal coverage within the target indoor areas. Our extensive experimental evaluation results have shown OptRe to enhance signal strength for different types of wireless signals by almost 2x. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

Enhanced computational and storage capabilities in smart cameras establish them as promising platforms for implementing intelligent and autonomous surveillance networks. However, poor resolution, limited number of samples per object, and pose variation in multi-view surveillance streams, make the task of efficient image representation highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for features extraction using embedded processing on smart cameras. Efficient, high performance, pre-trained CNNs are separately fine-tuned on persons and vehicles to obtain discriminative, low dimensional features from segmented surveillance objects.

A prototype MTS has been developed and its performance has been experimentally evaluated with two practical applications; outdoor obstacle avoidance and indoor navigation using only 1D map incorporating magnetic waypoints and an improved dynamic time warping method to estimate locations from the real-time measurements and pre-stored map.

abstract = {With the existence of "semantic gap" between the machine-readable low level features (e.g. visual features in terms of colors and textures) and high level human concepts, it is inherently hard for the machine to automatically identify and retrieve events from videos according to their semantics by merely reading pixels and frames. This paper proposes a human-centered framework for mining and retrieving events and applies it to indoor surveillance video databases. The goal is to locate video sequences containing events of interest to the user of the surveillance video database. This framework starts by tracking objects. Since surveillance videos cannot be easily segmented, the Common Appearance Intervals (CAIs) are used to segment videos, which have the flavor of shots in movies. The video segmentation provides an efficient indexing schema for the retrieval. The trajectories obtained are thus spatiotemporal in nature, based on which features are extracted for the construction of event models. In the retrieval phase, the database user interacts with the machine and provides "feedbacks" to the retrieval results. The proposed learning algorithm learns from the spatiotemporal data, the event model as well as the "feedbacks" and returns the refined results to the user. Specifically, the learning algorithm is a Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM), which models the interactions of objects in CAIs and recognizes hidden patterns among them. This iterative learning and retrieval process contributes to the bridging of the "semantic gap", and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework by demonstrating the increase of retrieval accuracy through iterations and comparing with other methods. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Along with the development of communication technology, the degree of involvement of location-based service in daily life increases accordingly. Through further combination between mobile devices and micro-location technology, mobile devices can now offer more precise and high-quality services which allow users to obtain required information while moving. The proposed intelligent device-oriented control system is based on the devices to be controlled and the location they use devices, providing a control service system with dynamic operation interface: When detecting the approaching users, the system would automatically notify users the available devices and provide users with the control options for the devices. The system function would come along with the device to be controlled, and the user interface would change with user's location and devices in the location, reducing the complexity of operation and enabling users to focus on the present objects to be operated. This system can be combined with I/O or smart devices, providing users with location-based device-oriented control service, making the update and maintenance of IoT application control system easier. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper we show that a geometric representation of an object occurring in indoor scenes, along with rich scene structure can be used to produce a detector for that object in a single image. Using perspective cues from the global scene geometry, we first develop a 3D based object detector. This detector is competitive with an image based detector built using state-of-the-art methods; however, combining the two produces a notably improved detector, because it unifies contextual and geometric information. We then use a probabilistic model that explicitly uses constraints imposed by spatial layout - the locations of walls and floor in the image - to refine the 3D object estimates. We use an existing approach to compute spatial layout [1], and use constraints such as objects are supported by floor and can not stick through the walls. The resulting detector (a) has significantly improved accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art 2D detectors and (b) gives a 3D interpretation of the location of the object, derived from a 2D image. We evaluate the detector on beds, for which we give extensive quantitative results derived from images of real scenes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Stereo images are obtained at various stereo baselines, resulting in enhanced resolution of depth, especially for distant objects. The length of each baseline is obtained by currently measuring the actual location and angular pose of robotic carrier of camera. Measurement errors bring about inaccuracies in depth.

abstract = {Improvements are presented for the radio frequency identification (RFID) location technology based on received signal strength indication (RSSI) in this paper. A semi-active tag with RSSI is designed, which increases the circuit of measuring the signal strength between the rectifier modules and digital modules, thus tags can measure the signal strength. This paper theoretically analyzes the method of signal received by tags to reduce the reflection interference. The method of bi-directional RSSI is proposed, which gets signal by tags and readers, and the spatial diversity technique is introduced, which can be utilized to compensate channel uncertainties such as multipath fading. The method of bi-directional RSSI is that tags and the reader can locate each other, and is a special spatial diversity technique. In this paper, spatial diversity is exploited for locating stationary and mobile objects in the indoor environment. Space diversity technique is introduced for small scale motion and temporal variation compensation of received signal strength and it is demonstrated analytically that it enhances location accuracy. The three common linear combining approaches are selection combining (SC), maximal ratio combining (MRC) and equal gain combining (EGC). Taking into account the ease of implementation, SC is adopted in the paper. It is theoretically analyzed that the method of bi-directional RSSI can be effectively against multipath fading, improve signal reception gain, and enhance the communication quality. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

There is a critical need for cost-effective, reliable, and fairly accurate solutions to meet the demands of indoor robotic applications. Currently, researchers are exploring various approaches for this problem. The one we are presenting in this paper is based on QR (Quick Response) codes to provide location references for mobile robots. The mobile robot is equipped with a Smartphone that is programmed to detect and read information on QR codes that are strategically placed in the operating environment of the robot. The mobile robot can perform the autonomous run throughout the guide route by using real-time QR code recognition. The lab information on QR code is played to the visitors using Text-to-Speech provided through Android device. Ultrasonic range sensors which can detect objects and measure distances with high accuracy are used to implement the wall-following and obstacle-avoidance behaviors. The collected sonar range information by ultrasonic range sensors is processed by a microcontroller that autonomously controls a tour guide robot. An algorithm based on a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is applied to the tour guide robot to perform more accurate robot motion control. A Bluetooth technology is used to send stored information on QR codes from the Smartphone to the tour guide robot wirelessly. The experimental setup of the tour guide robot along with the successful implementation of the efficient method for a navigation technique is presented. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents research that investigated algorithms for high-precision identification of contextual information in location-aware engineering applications. The primary contribution of the presented work is the design and implementation of a dynamic user-viewpoint tracking scheme in which mobile users' spatial context is defined not only by their position (i.e., location), but also by their three-dimensional head orientation (i.e., line of sight). This allows the identification of objects and artifacts visible in a mobile user's field of view with much higher accuracy than was possible by tracking position alone. For outdoor applications, a georeferencing based algorithm has been developed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and magnetic orientation tracking devices [5] to track a user's dynamic viewpoint. For indoor applications, this study explored the applicability of wireless technologies, in particular Indoor GPS, for dynamic user position tracking in situations where GPS is unavailable. The objectives of this paper are to describe the details of the three-stage-algorithm that has been designed and implemented, and to demonstrate the extent to which positioning technologies such as GPS and Indoor GPS can be used together with high-precision orientation trackers to accurately interpret the fully-qualified spatial context of a mobile user in challenging environments such as those found on construction sites. The obtained results highlight the potential of using location-aware technologies for rapidly identifying and retrieving contextual information in engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the model retrieval stage, line drawings are extracted from 2D objects and 3D models by using different line rendering methods. We exploit various tokens to represent local features and then organize them together as a star-graph to show a global description.

Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints. Nonnegative discretization is used to enforce the mutual exclusion constraint, which guarantees a person detection output to only belong to exactly one individual.

Although the number of tags in indoor environment continues growing fast, objects cannot be always assumed tagged, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Compared to tagged objects, a tagless target which neither emits nor modulates signal is much more difficult to locate, especially when the size is small. In this paper, we achieve accurate tagless object locating through a dense and wide non-uniform sampling in the Fourier domain of target reflectivity with the help of ambient passive RFID tags as landmarks. Unlike conventional RFID systems, we leverage nonlinearity in passive tags to backscatter second harmonic signals. The frequency separation of uplink and downlink in harmonic RFID allows ready interference cancellation. We embrace spatial diversity enabled by ambient tags and frequency diversity by broadband harmonic backscattering to improve accuracy and robustness. We present the fundamental theory and a prototype system to verify the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

The view on which it is based is artifact-centered and uses sensors attached to the everyday artifacts (called smart objects) in the real world. This paper makes two main contributions: First, it addresses, the robustness of the embedded sensors, which is seldom discussed in previous smart artifact research. Because sensors may sometimes be broken or fail to work under certain conditions, smart objects become hidden ones. However, current systems provide no mechanism to detect and manage objects when this problem occurs. Second, there is no common context infrastructure for building smart artifact systems, which makes it difficult for separately developed applications to interact with each other and uneasy for them to share and reuse knowledge. Unlike previous systems, Home-Explorer builds on an ontology-based knowledge infrastructure named Sixth-Sense, which makes it easy for the system to interact with other applications or agents also based on this ontology. The hidden object problem is also reflected in our ontology, which enables Home-Explorer to deal with both smart objects and hidden objects. A set of rules for deducing an object's status or location information and for locating hidden objects are described and evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract = {Device-free localization of people and objects indoors not equipped with radios is playing a critical role in many emerging applications. This paper presents a novel channel state information (CSI) pre-processing scheme that enables accurate device-free localization indoors. The basic idea is simple: CSI is sensitive to a target's location and by modelling the CSI measurements of multiple wireless links as a set of power fading based equations, the target location can be determined. However, due to rich multipaths in indoor environment, the received signal strength (RSS) or even the fine-grained CSI can not be easily modelled. We observe that even in a rich multipath environment, not all subcarriers are equally affected by multipath reflections. Our preprocessing scheme tries to identify the subcarriers not affected by multipath. Thus, CSIs on the "clean" subcarriers can be modelled and utilized for accurate localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-processing scheme. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions that many devices can connect to a network. Visible Light Communication (VLC) based on Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) is an attractive communication fabric for the IoT, as LEDs are readily available and can serve as transmitters as well as receivers. LED light bulbs, enhanced with photodiodes, provide an attractive path to extend device-to-device communication to room area networking. This paper describes a VLC system, called EnLighting, based on light bulbs that support an embedded Linux version (and its complete networking stack). These programmable light bulbs can both send and receive; they can communicate with objects in a room as well as with other light bulbs nearby. Bidirectional communication allows a light bulb to actively participate in networking and simplifies deployment, maintenance, configuration, and controllability of indoor lighting installations and services. EnLighting supports low-bandwidth communication services in a room (and via a gateway, beyond the room), which provide the base for other applications, e.g., a location service. This paper includes an initial evaluation of a room area communication and localization network based on prototype Linux-enabled light bulbs, reporting the performance for different network traffic types, and shows the benefits obtained from bidirectional communication. This proof-of- concept system illustrates that simple devices can provide an attractive solution to future communication challenges in the saturated radio spectrum. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a novel framework for tracking of a long sequence of human activities, including the time instances of change from one activity to the next, using a closed-loop, non-linear dynamical feedback system. A composite feature vector describing the shape, color and motion of the objects, and a non-linear, piecewise stationary, stochastic dynamical model describing its spatio-temporal evolution, are used for tracking. The tracking error or expected log likelihood, which serves as a feedback signal, is used to automatically detect changes and switch between activities happening one after another in a long video sequence. Whenever a change is detected, the tracker is reinitialized automatically by comparing the input image with learned models of the activities. Unlike some other approaches that can track a sequence of activities, we do not need to know the transition probabilities between the activities, which can be difficult to estimate in many application scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on multiple indoor and outdoor real-life videos and analyze its performance. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {People spend a significant amount of time in indoor spaces (e.g., office buildings, subway systems, etc.) in their daily lives. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient indoor spatial query algorithms for supporting various location-based applications. However, indoor spaces differ from outdoor spaces because users have to follow the indoor floor plan for their movements. In addition, positioning in indoor environments is mainly based on sensing devices (e.g., RFID readers) rather than GPS devices. Consequently, we cannot apply existing spatial query evaluation techniques devised for outdoor environments for this new challenge. Because particle filters can be employed to estimate the state of a system that changes over time using a sequence of noisy measurements made on the system, in this research, we propose the particle filter-based location inference method as the basis for evaluating indoor spatial queries with noisy RFID raw data. Furthermore, two novel models, indoor walking graph model and anchor point indexing model, are created for tracking object locations in indoor environments. Based on the inference method and tracking models, we develop innovative indoor range and k nearest neighbor (kNN) query algorithms. We validate our solution through extensive simulations with real-world parameters. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can evaluate indoor spatial queries effectively and efficiently. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Many localization algorithms and systems have been developed by means of wireless sensor networks for both indoor and outdoor environments. To achieve higher localization accuracy, extra hardware equipments are utilized by most of the existing localization solutions, which increase the cost and considerably limit the location-based applications. The Internet of Things (IOT) integrates many technologies, such as Internet, Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared, WiFi, GPRS, 3G, etc., which can enable different ways to obtain the location information of various objects. Location-based service is a primary service of the IOT, while localization accuracy is a key issue. In this paper, a higher accuracy localization scheme is proposed which can effectively satisfy diverse requirements for many indoor and outdoor location services. The proposed scheme composes of two phases: (1) the partition phase, in which the target region is split into small grids; (2) the localization refinement phase, in which a higher accuracy of localization can be obtained by applying an algorithm designed in the paper. A trial system is set up to verify correctness of the proposed scheme and furthermore to illustrate its feasibility and availability. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the localization accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This paper propose a way of managing a dynamic indoor environment by defining a multi-layered indoor model in terms of an object mobility. It allows an indoor space to be managed more elaborate and realistic than up-to-date indoor models which only consider an indoor floor plan. We firstly define a classification of indoor objects based on their characteristic to frequently change location, and propose three-layers indoor model followed by the classified objects with its mobility. Secondly, we design and implement an autonomous scanning system to understand changes of indoor situation quickly and automatically.

Therefore, this paper investigates the influences of RSSI and the distance to RFID and analyzes the common indoor localization algorithms, including range-based algorithms and range-free algorithms. However, there are too many interference factors in the indoor environment that easily lead to localization inaccuracy. To improve the RF-mapping technique in RFID that requires much time for initiation and lots of calculations, this paper proposes a GA-based (Genetic Algorithms, GA) localization algorithm to estimate the locations of unknown nodes and avoid the influence of environmental factors by preestablishing the pattern. The designed scenarios and reference nodes in this paper are used to train our proposed algorithm and obtain the patents of the scenarios, which are adopted for RFID nodes to further compare and decrease errors. Therefore, as long as the algorithm is trained in advance with the scenarios and then include the patents in the new environment, the errors and the training time can be greatly reduced. Moreover, our proposed algorithm needs only little information about reference nodes to preestablish the pattern. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.},

abstract = {Indoor localization is becoming an important application for wireless sensor networks. In order to determine sensors location, ranging packets need to be transmitted. Therefore, a good scheduling scheme is needed in order to avoid collision during packet transmission. Current wireless cellular network allows sensors inside the network to transmit without packet collision by using frequency reuse method or assigning different orthogonal code sequences to every individual sensor so that they can transmit at the same time. One of the drawbacks in the earlier method is the requirement for a large frequency band that must be wide enough to allocate frequencies to all the sensors inside a network. For the latter method, there is a limited number of code sequences that can be assigned to all the sensors inside the network. Therefore in this paper, we first proposed a time scheduling method for ranging packet transmission to avoid packet collision in order to locate a large number of people or objects inside an indoor environment at the same time. The proposed method allows sensors to transmit at different time slot. They are able to use the same frequency across the entire network and interference between neighboring cells is avoided. In addition, frequency guard band is no longer required, therefore, it is bandwidth saving. This makes the system to be scalable to large network coverage, low cost and simple to operate. Secondly, we modified our localization method to suit this time scheduling scheme so that it can perform both offline and online localization for a multi-cell indoor environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Bag-of-words (BoW) methods constitute a popular approach to map retrieval; however, these methods have extremely limited descriptive ability because they ignore the spatial layout information of the local features. The main contribution of this paper is an extension of the bag-of-words map retrieval method to enable the use of spatial information from local features. Our strategy is to explicitly model a unique viewpoint of an input local map; the pose of the local feature is defined with respect to this unique viewpoint, and can be viewed as an additional invariant feature for discriminative map retrieval. Specifically, we wish to determine a unique viewpoint that is invariant to moving objects, clutter, occlusions, and actual viewpoints. Hence, we perform scene parsing to analyze the scene structure, and consider the "center" of the scene structure to be the unique viewpoint. Our scene parsing is based on a Manhattan world grammar that imposes a quasi-Manhattan world constraint to enable the robust detection of a scene structure that is invariant to clutter and moving objects. Experimental results using the publicly available radish dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {We introduce Harmonium, a novel ultra wideband (UWB) RF localization architecture that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors. Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates. Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive, lightweight, and FCC-compliant UWB transmitter or tag, fixed infrastructure anchors with known locations, and centralized processing that calculates the tag's position. Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that rejects narrowband interferers and extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of traditional UWB approaches. In a complex indoor environment, 90{\%} of position estimates obtained with Harmonium exhibit less than 31 cm of error with an average of 9 cm of inter-sample noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e., through-wall), 90{\%} of position error is less than 42 cm. The tag draws 75 mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9 mJ per location fix at the 19 Hz update rate. Tags weigh 3 g and cost {\$}4.50 USD at modest volumes. Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium concepts in future integrated systems. Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors, devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture systems. {\textcopyright} 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

These applications are composed of sensors that generate various and heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. Exploiting this spatio-temporal data to support video surveillance systems remains a relevant purpose for video content filtering. Since the data processed in such a context are heterogeneous (indoor and outdoor environment, various position types and reference systems, various data format), interoperability and management of these data remains a problem to be solved. In this paper, we define an approach that integrates camera location and field of view metadata, mobile objects trajectories, and metadata from video content analysis algorithms (e.g. detection and movement of mobile objects) to address problems related to processing of huge amount of data (big data) generated by CCTV systems. We propose a new generic trajectory based query in order to handle trajectory segment's heterogeneity for both environments (indoor and outdoor). The proposed data model integrate multi-source metadata and enable to handle interoperability issue of data.

We provide an experimental evaluation demonstrating the utility of our approach in a real-world case. Results show that the proposed approach enhances the efficiency of investigators by reducing the search space, as the operator will analyze only the relevant data, therefore he needs less time for video processing (video reviewing). {\textcopyright} 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract = {Indoor tracking and localization is a crucial ingredient in many ubiquitous computing applications and robotics. In many applications there is the need to know the location of the objects. While in the near future everything will be tagged with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, the localization of these tags in their environment is becoming an important feature for the RFID based ubiquitous computing applications. Due to its lower cost and its technical capabilities, RFID Tagged object tracking can have a wide diverse variety of applications including scientific, military, and public safety. In this paper we propose a tracking algorithm for objects attached by UHF RFID tags by means of two RFID antennas and landmarks to reduce the localization cost and environment complexity. This algorithm uses RFID map made from passive or active references tags with known location (landmarks) to locate any unknown tag detected by the RFID Reader antennas. It measures the distances between the readers and the common detected tags using the large scale path loss propagation model, and calculates the distance between the unknown tag and all the detected landmarks (Inter-tags distance). With the multilateration technique the system is able to estimate the position of the unknown tag. The location estimation of the target will be independent to the reader's position. The research challenge corresponds to achieve an accurate indoor tracking system using two mobile RFID Readers taking in consideration the limitation of RFID technology. This tracking algorithm is based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurement to measure the reader-tags distance and target-landmarks distance to estimate the target location. To minimize the effect of the RSS and the process measurement noises on the position estimation, Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), Map Matching and Kalman filter are applied. Here, we investigate the use of Kalman filter to improve the precision and RFID map matching to improve the accuracy. Results obtained after simulations demonstrate the validity and suitability of the proposed algorithm to provide high performance level in terms of accuracy and scalability. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The proliferation of mobile computing devices and wireless positioning networks has fostered a growing interest in location-aware systems and devices. Most technologies such as Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), RADAR, etc, use at least three Base Station (BS) for calculating position of target objects. This paper describes an improvement of the previous OneBS algorithm [13]. The proposed system uses only one BS based on the RFID infrastructure for positioning target tags amid the clutter of indoor interference environments. We proposed to fuse the Round-trip Time of Flight (RTOF) and the Received Signal Strength (RSS) in the positioning algorithm. Both information are kept in an intersection Box (iBox). The RTOF information is used to focus a target tag's position among groups of four-nearestneighbor reference tags kept within iBox. Then, the RSS information is weighted using the weighted center of gravity technique to estimate a location of the target tags. Our experiments are based on Three Dimension (3D) materials within interference environments. The interference environments are simulated based on Uniform Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (UTD), for measuring signals in each specific area. Our proposed algorithm gains 50 percents better average distance error compared to the OneBS algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Indoor localization based on signal strength fingerprinting has received significant attention from the community. This method is attractive because it does not require complex hardware beyond off-the-shelf radio transceivers. However, its main limitation is the inaccuracy caused by the variability of the signal strength. When applied to the localization of people, the signal variability can be attributed to three main sources: environmental dynamics (movement of people or objects), movement of transceiver (changes in the position and/or orientation of the transceivers) and body effects (distortion of the wireless signal due to body absorption). Our work focuses on the impact of the last two sources and provides two important contributions. First, we present an analysis to quantify the effects of antenna disorientation and transceiver misplacement. For the RFID system used in our work, these effects can decrease the localization accuracy by up to 50{\%}. Motivated by these results, we identify parts of the human body where tags are less affected by unintentional movements and describe how multiple transceivers can be used to overcome the absorption effects of the human body. We validate our findings through an extensive set of measurements gathered in a home environment. Our tests indicate that by following a set of simple guidelines, we can increase the localization accuracy (the percentage of correct location estimations) by a factor of four (from 20{\%} to 88{\%}), and reduce the maximum localization error (from 7 to 4 m). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Many researches have verified that most people spend their time in an indoor environment. In this paper, we propose two novel index structures, called Split Grid Index (SGI) and N-Density Split Grid Index (N-DSGI) for indexing moving objects in an indoor environment. SGI divides the grid into a set of cells when a new moving object enters. In particular, if a moving object moves into a grid cell, it is recursively divided into a set of smaller cells until each grid cell includes only one moving object. On the other hand, in N-DSGI, the grid is divided into a set of cells when (i) a new moving object enters the grid cell R and (ii) the number of moving objects in R exceeds the threshold value N. Through simulations, we verify that SGI and N-DSGI save CPU time while providing clients the valuable information. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {We consider the task of long-term visual SLAM, i.e., simultaneous localization and mapping, in a partially changing environment (SLAM-PCE). The main problem we face is how to obtain discriminative and compact visual landmarks, which are necessary to cope with changes in appearance in an environment and with a large amount of visual information. We address this issue by proposing the use of common object patterns, which are inherent in typical environments (e.g., indoor, street, forests, suburban, etc.), as visual landmarks for a SLAM-PCE task. In our contributions, we describe our approach, 'part-based SLAM', and validate its effectiveness within a standard problem of view image retrieval. The main novelty of this approach lies in that the common landmark objects are extracted in an unsupervised manner via common pattern discovery, and can be used for compact characterization and efficient retrieval of view images. Our method is also innovative in its use of traditional bounding box-based part annotation: an image is represented in a compact form, 'bag-of-bounding-boxes (BoBB)' and then, the scene matching can be solved efficiently as a low dimensional problem of matching bounding boxes. The results of challenging experiments show that it is possible to have high retrieval performance with compact image representation with only 16 words per image. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The IoT metadata can cover different levels, from the radiosignal strength and the media-access controller (MAC) addressto device name, indoor location, temperature, humidity, airquality, and advertising messages. These IoT data can readilyaugment metadata such as timestamp, GPS location, and camerasettings already captured by today's cameras and saved indigital photo files. With such IoT metadata, the user will havemuch richer ways to understand the subject and environmentof the scene being captured by the photo or media, such as thesubject's fitness condition, the advertised events, and the taggedpersonal items at the scene. These metadata will enable newways of searching, querying, and organizing the photos and theassociated objects. Moreover, a novel mechanism we proposeis the ability to pair with a remote device whose identity androuting information is captured as IoT metadata, so that anauthorized user can then pair with it at a later time remotely.

abstract = {One major goal of vision is to infer physical models of objects, surfaces, and their layout from sensors. In this paper, we aim to interpret indoor scenes from one RGBD image. Our representation encodes the layout of orthogonal walls and the extent of objects, modeled with CAD-like 3D shapes. We parse both the visible and occluded portions of the scene and all observable objects, producing a complete 3D parse. Such a scene interpretation is useful for robotics and visual reasoning, but difficult to produce due to the well-known challenge of segmentation, the high degree of occlusion, and the diversity of objects in indoor scenes. We take a data-driven approach, generating sets of potential object regions, matching to regions in training images, and transferring and aligning associated 3D models while encouraging fit to observations and spatial consistency. We use support inference to aid interpretation and propose a retrieval scheme that uses convolutional neural networks to classify regions and retrieve objects with similar shapes.

The detection of small objects is also challenging because the search space is very large in 3D scenes. However, we observe that much of the shape variation within 3D object categories can be explained by the location of a latent support surface, and smaller objects are often supported by larger objects. Therefore, we explicitly use latent support surfaces to better represent the 3D appearance of large objects, and provide contextual cues to improve the detection of small objects.

In the broader context of autonomous exploration, the ability to travel between floors of a building should be compatible with path planning, such that the robot can traverse a stairway at a time that is appropriate to its navigation goals. No system yet presented is capable of both localizing stairways on a map and estimating their properties, functions that in combination would enable stairways to be considered as traversable terrain in a path planning algorithm. We propose a method for modeling stairways as objects and localizing them on a map, such that they can be subsequently traversed if they are of dimensions that the robotic platform is capable of climbing. Our system consists of two parts: a computationally efficient detector that leverages geometric cues from depth imagery to detect sets of ascending stairs, and a stairway modeler that uses multiple detections to infer the location and parameters of a stairway that is discovered during exploration. This video demonstrates the performance of the system in a number of real-world situations, modeling and localizing a variety of stairway types in both indoor and outdoor environments. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel computer vision-based perception system, dedicated to the autonomous navigation of visually impaired people. A first feature concerns the real-time detection and recognition of obstacles and moving objects present in potentially cluttered urban scenes. To this purpose, a motion-based, real-time object detection and classification method is proposed. The method requires no a priori information about the obstacle type, size, position or location. In order to enhance the navigation/positioning capabilities offered by traditional GPS-based approaches, which are often unreliably in urban environments, a building/landmark recognition approach is also proposed. Finally, for the specific case of indoor applications, the system has the possibility to learn a set of user-defined objects of interest. Here, multi-object identification and tracking is applied in order to guide the user to localize such objects of interest. The feedback is presented to user by audio warnings/alerts/indications. Bone conduction headphones are employed in order to allow visually impaired to hear the systems warnings without obstructing the sounds from the environment. At the hardware level, the system is totally integrated on an android smartphone which makes it easy to wear, non-invasive and low-cost. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {In the current paper, we describe a three dimensional indoor positioning system for the metal industry. The developed system consists of a three dimensional map-based user interface scanned with Leica ScanStation 2, Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation (CSS) indoor positioning technology, and a used positioning algorithm. The system development process described in this paper includes three phases. Firstly, the modelling of three dimensional virtual environments with an accuracy of 2 centimeters required the use of point cloud processing software and 3D content creation. The next phase was to find reliable indoor positioning technology for harsh industrial conditions. The results reported in this paper show that a reliable positioning system using CSS could be created. Finally, location information provided by CSS was shown in the three dimensional map-based user interface. The user interface was based on CENTRIA's Locawe platform. The process described in this paper shows that moving objects such as mobile robots, autonomous transporters or working machines can be tracked in a three dimensional virtual environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Examples of tagged objects are patients or equipment in a hospital whilst discovered objects could be people in burning buildings or soldiers on a battlefield. Ultra Wide Band (UWB) location determination aims at delivering high positional accuracy in harsh industrial environments that cause problems for traditional systems due to electromagnetic interference. UWB systems can calculate the location of tags which are designed to be mounted on assets or worn by a person. They transmit UWB signals that are received by sensors which contain an array of antenna and ultra-wideband radio receivers. The data from these sensors combined with dedicated software uses algorithms to work out the angle of arrival (AOA) of the UWB signal from the tag which is then compared to the time difference of arrival (TDOA). The robotics industry can benefit from advanced location detection systems. We examine here the use of ultra wide band technology in tracking items such as mobile robots. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

One of most important tasks in AR technology is to estimate the target objects' position information in real environment. The existed AR systems mostly utilize specialized marker to locate, some AR systems track real 3D object in real environment but need to get the the position information of index points in environment in advance. The above methods are not efficiency and limit the application of AR system, so that solving indoor localization problem has significant meaning for the development of AR technology. The development of computer vision (CV) techniques and the ubiquity of intelligent devices with cameras provides the foundation for offering accurate localization services. However, pure CV-based solutions usually involve hundreds of photos and pre-calibration to construct an densely sampled 3D model, which is a labor-intensive overhead for practical deployment. And a large amount of computation cost is difficult to satisfy the requirement for efficiency in mobile device. In this paper, we present iStart, a lightweight, easy deployed, image-based indoor localization system, which can be run on smart phone and VR/AR devices like HTC Vive, Google Glasses and so on. With core techniques rooted in data hierarchy scheme of WiFi fingerprints and photos, iStart also acquires user localization with a single photo of surroundings with high accuracy and short delay. Extensive experiments in various environments show that 90 percentile location deviations are less than 1 m, and 60 percentile location deviations are less than 0.5 m. {\textcopyright} 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Focusing on an image sensor deployed in smart devices, we develop a visual light communication (VLC)-based location data transferal method. A light emitting diode (LED) generates a specific light signal, which is easily detected by image sensors. The algorithmic procedure of light signal recognition is implemented by using the image processing functions of smart devices. The image extracted from the light signal can be interpreted as unique location data. The proposed method can strengthen the advantages of the indoor applicability of VLC. The applicability of VLC is additionally reinforced by the concept of software defined light network reconfiguration. All data were harvested using actual measurements in indoor areas.

abstract = {Properly incorporating location-uncertainties – which is, fully considering their impact when processing queries of interest – is a paramount in any application dealing with spatio-temporal data. Typically, the location-uncertainty is a consequence of the fact that objects cannot be tracked continuously and the inherent imprecision of localization devices. Although there is a large body of works tackling various aspects of efficient management of uncertainty in spatio-temporal data – the settings consider homogeneous localization devices, e.g., either a Global Positioning System (GPS), or different sensors (roadside, indoor, etc.).In this work, we take a first step towards combining the uncertain location data – i.e., fusing the uncertainty of moving objects location – obtained from both GPS devices and roadside sensors. We develop a formal model for capturing the whereabouts in time in this setting and propose the Fused Bead (FB) model, extending the bead model based solely on GPS locations. We also present algorithms for answering traditional spatio-temporal range queries, as well as a special variant pertaining to objects locations with respect to lanes on road segments – augmenting the conventional graph based road network with the width attribute. In addition, pruning techniques are proposed in order to expedite the query processing. We evaluated the benefits of the proposed approach on both real (Beijing taxi) and synthetic (generated from a customized trajectory generator) data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method of fusing the uncertainties may eliminate up to 26 {\%} of the false positives in the Beijing taxi data, and up to 40 {\%} of the false positives in the larger synthetic dataset, when compared to using the traditional bead uncertainty models. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The system uses Gaussian Filtering for motion detection and then performs partitioning to grab location of all targets in the scene. Due to partitioning, the scene has three major regions while each of which has different sub-regions. Based on the partitioning and position of all targets, the system might be in three states of unsafe state, safe state, and over-safe state. In each state regarding specific regions or sub-regions, the system picks appropriate movement not only to be capable of capturing all moving objects, but also to give equal chance of capturing to new targets entering to the scene from different direction. The system is tested in both of indoor and outdoor with different values for different parameters such as resolutions, fps (frame-per-second), minimum number of motion frames, and minimum areas of motion.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality systems often require the tracking of a user's pose in a large area to implement the registration between virtual object and the real world. To solve such a problem, this paper proposes a novel tracking system based on invisible projected markers which are created with an infrared projector. To enlarge the tracking area using only a limited number of markers, the system adopts a primary-secondary marker deployment solution, in which the primary marker uses an improved two-dimensional barcode and can be identified uniquely. The secondary marker is a simple light-spot, whose code is identified through the location relationship with the nearby primary markers and is used for the pose calculation. The system tracks the invisible markers using an IR (Infrared) camera, which means that it works in a way similar to a robust marker-less tracking system. A prototype is built to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed tracking system, experimental result shows that the proposed system meets the requirements of accuracy for large-area tracking.

However, cast shadows are often falsely labeled as foreground objects, which may severely degrade the accuracy of object localization and detection. Effective shadow detection is necessary for accurate foreground segmentation, especially for outdoor scenes. Based on the characteristics of shadows, such as luminance reduction, chromaticity invariance and texture invariance, we introduce a nonparametric framework for modeling surface behavior under cast shadows. To each pixel, we assign a potential shadow value with a confidence weight, indicating the probability that the pixel location is an actual shadow point. Given an observed RGB value for a pixel in a new frame, we use its recent spatio-temporal context to compute an expected shadow RGB value. The similarity between the observed and the expected shadow RGB values determines whether a pixel position is a true shadow.

For spatial similarity, we propose to detect the critical points in trajectories and then use them to determine spatial similarity. This approach can lower the computational costs of similarity search. Moreover, it helps achieve a more effective measure of spatial similarity because it removes noisy points. For semantic pattern similarity, we propose to construct a hierarchical semantic pattern to capture the semantics of trajectories. This method makes it possible to capture the implicit semantic similarity among different semantic labels of locations, and enables more meaningful measures of semantic similarity among indoor trajectories.

With experiments done on the exploration, object recognition individually we show the robustness of this approach for object search task. We analyse and compare our method with two other strategies for localizing the object empirically and show unequivocally that the strategy based on the probabilistic formalism in general performs better than the other two. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Advances in real-time location system (RTLS) solutions have enabled us to collect massive amounts of fine-grained semantically rich location traces, which provide unparalleled opportunities for understanding human activities and discovering useful knowledge. This, in turn, delivers intelligence for real-time decision making in various fields, such as workflow management. Indeed, it is a new paradigm for workflow modeling by the knowledge discovery in location traces. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of workflow modeling by the integrated analysis of indoor location traces in the hospital environment. In comparison with conventional workflow modeling based on passive workflow logs, one salient feature of our approach is that it can proactively unravel the workflow patterns hidden in the location traces, by automatically constructing the workflow states and estimating parameters describing the transition patterns of moving objects. Specifically, to determine a meaningful granularity for the model, the workflow states are first constructed as regions associated with specific healthcare activities. Then, we transform the original indoor location traces to the sequences of workflow states and model the workflow transition patterns by finite state machines. Furthermore, we leverage the correlations in the location traces between related types of medical devices to reinforce the modeling performance and enable more applications. The results show that the proposed framework can not only model the workflow patterns effectively, but also have managerial applications in workflow monitoring, auditing, and inspection of workflow compliance, which are critical in the healthcare industry. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {This paper presents a service concept that enables the virtual augmentation of physical objects through a mobile device. Each object is linked to a tree of virtual resources (e.g. digital contents). Resources are organized in levels-of-detail that depend on the user's distance and orientation towards the object itself (i.e. user's attitude). The root node of the content tree hosts a set of items that can be retrieved from the most distant position to the object; each depth level in the tree is associated to the observer's attitude towards the object, thus the structure facilitates 'spatial browsing' of information. On this concept, we have implemented an indoor sensor-based Augmented Reality system that relies on a RFID positioning mat for positioning. To complete the attitude calculation and to adjust the service interface, we have handled typical indoor problems such as compass calibration and its bias management. The service has been instantiated to augment a TV set to spatially browse geography contents; the content tree is organized in continent, country and city levels and delivers synchronized resources to the mobile interface and to the TV, depending on the user's attitude and its previous interactions. Results of a limited user test show that the service concept is acceptable to the users and underline the need to get better control of resources representation. Although the chosen object for demonstration is a media one, the concept is applicable to any kind of object. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

However, existing tracking methods, such as GPS, Wi-Fi and RFID, have technological drawbacks or impose significant costs, thus limiting their applications in many clinical environments, especially those with indoor enclosures. This paper proposes a low-cost and flexible tracking system that is well suited for operating in an indoor environment. Based on readily available RF transceivers and microcontrollers, our wearable sensor system can facilitate locating users (e.g., patients or doctors) or objects (e.g., medical devices) in a building. The strategic construction of the sensor system, along with a suitably designed tracking algorithm, together provide for reliability and dispatch in localization performance. For demonstration purposes, several simplified experiments, with different configurations of the system, are implemented in two testing rooms to assess the baseline performance. From the obtained results, our system exhibits immense promise in acquiring a user location and corresponding time-stamp, with high accuracy and rapid response. This capability is conducive to both short- and long-term data analytics, which are crucial for improving healthcare management. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Indoor positioning enables location-based services for a wide range of commercial applications [4]. Existing visible light positioning (VLP) systems [5, 7] leverage the high image resolution of a receiving camera to support high positioning accuracy. However, power-hungry cameras are not desirable in many scenarios, e.g., smart factories, where small objects need to be accurately located and tracked. In this demo, we introduce CELLI, an indoor VLP system that only uses a single luminary as the transmitter and requires only a simple light sensor to achieve high accuracy with centimeter-level error. The key idea is to provide the spatial resolution capability from the transmitter instead of the receiver, so that the complexity of the receiver can be minimized. In particular, a small Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is installed at the transmitter to project a large number of narrow and interference-free polarized light beams to different spatial cells. A receiving light sensor identifies its located cell by detecting the unique polarization-modulated signals projected to that cell, as shown in Fig. 1. CELLI further incorporates several novel designs to overcome the technical challenges such as reducing the positioning latency, which is typically limited by the long optical response time of an LCD, and transforming a cell coordinate to the global 3D position using only a single light. We have prototyped our design using off-the-shelf optical and electronic components, and experimentally shown that CELLI achieves a median 3D positioning error less than 12 cm and a median 2D error less than 2.7 cm. {\textcopyright} 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {To facilitate a variety of applications, positioning systems are deployed in indoor settings. For example, Bluetooth and RFID positioning are deployed in airports to support real-time monitoring of delays as well as off-line flow and space usage analyses. Such deployments generate large collections of tracking data. Like in other data management applications, joins are indispensable in this setting. However, joins on indoor tracking data call for novel techniques that take into account the limited capabilities of the positioning systems as well as the specifics of indoor spaces. This paper proposes and studies probabilistic, spatio-temporal joins on historical indoor tracking data. Two meaningful types of join are defined. They return object pairs that satisfy spatial join predicates either at a time point or during a time interval. The predicates considered include same X, where X is a semantic region such as a room or hallway. Based on an analysis on the uncertainty inherent to indoor tracking data, effective join probabilities are formalized and evaluated for object pairs. Efficient two-phase hash-based algorithms are proposed for the point and interval joins. In a filter-and-refine framework, an R-tree variant is proposed that facilitates the retrieval of join candidates, and pruning rules are supplied that eliminate candidate pairs that do not qualify. An empirical study on both synthetic and real data shows that the proposed techniques are efficient and scalable. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Realizing automatic object search by robots in an indoor environment is one of the most important and challenging topics in mobile robot research. If the target object does not exist in a nearby area, the obvious strategy is to go to the area in which it was last observed. We have developed a robot system that collects 3D-scene data in an indoor environment during automatic routine crawling, and also detects objects quickly through a global search of the collected 3D-scene data. The 3D-scene data can be obtained automatically by transforming color images and range images into a set of color voxel data using self-location information. To detect an object, the system moves the bounding box of the target object by a certain step in the color voxel data, extracts 3D features in each box region, and computes the similarity between these features and the target object's features, using an appropriate feature projection learned beforehand. Taking advantage of the additive property of our 3D features, both feature extraction and similarity calculation are considerably accelerated. In the object learning process, the system obtains the feature-projection matrix by weighting unique features of the target object rather than its common features, resulting in reducing object detection errors. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Applications of these techniques are in indoor localization, gesture recognition, inventory tracking, vehicular motion, and many others. This paper identifies room for improvement over today's motion tracking techniques. The core observation is that conventional systems have trusted gravity more than the magnetic North to infer the 3D orientation of the object. We find that the reverse is more effective, especially when the object is in continuous fast motion. We leverage this opportunity to design MUSE, a magnetometer-centric sensor fusion algorithm for orientation tracking. Moreover, when the object's motion is somewhat restricted (e.g., human-arm motion restricted by elbow and shoulder joints), we find new methods of sensor fusion to fully leverage the restrictions. Real experiments across a wide range of uncontrolled scenarios show consistent improvement in orientation and location accuracy, without requiring any training or machine learning. We believe this is an important progress in the otherwise mature field of IMU-based motion tracking. {\textcopyright} 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to generate semantic-based trajectories for indoor moving objects. Indoor moving objects management has been a research focus in recent years. In order to get the trajectory data of indoor moving objects, we have to deply numerous positioning equipments, such as RFID readers and tags. In addition, it is a very complex and costly process to construct different environment settings for various indoor applications. To solve those problems, we propose to use virtual positioning equipments, e.g. RFID readers and tags, to simulate indoor environment. Furthermore, we present a semantic-based approach to generating trajectories for indoor moving objects, which takes into account the type of moving objects, the relationship between moving objects and locations, and the distribution of the trajectories. Compared with previous approaches, our method is more realistic for the simulation of indoor scenarios, and can provide useful trajectory data for further indoor data management analysis. Finally, we design and implement a tool for the generation of semantic-based trajectories for indoor moving objects, and conduct a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show that it can generate semantic-based trajectories for indoor moving objects according to different parameters and semantic settings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

In essence we intend to spot activities such as opening a cupboard, pressing a button, or taking an object from a shelve in a large data stream that contains typical every day activity. We focus on body-worn sensors without instrumenting objects, we exploit available infrastructure information, and we perform a one-to-many-users training scheme for minimal training effort. We demonstrate that a state of the art motion sensors based approach performs poorly under such conditions (Equal Error Rate of 18{\%} in our experiments). We present and evaluate a new multi modal system based on a combination of indoor location with a wrist mounted proximity sensor, camera and inertial sensor that raises the EER to 79{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Furthermore we want to treat the illumination change as a mathematical/physical transformation procedure on images. Therefore the intention to this paper could also be defined as to provide an operator, which is invariant to transformations. The proposed detector relies on a model assigning a vector to every pixel location of the reference and the current image. The vector represents information on the neighborhood region of that pixel. Based on the above definition, the theorem of linear dependence of vectors is used to describe an operator for the detection of objects. For the purpose of an objective evaluation, the proposed technique is compared to the state-of-the-art Statistical Change Detection method. The proposed operator proved to be robust to noise as well as global illumination changes and local shadows and reflections. {\textcopyright} 2000 EUSIPCO.},

In this context, the Smart Homes are getting more and more attention, since people are very attracted by the idea of a home environment able to automatically meet their needs. However, the heterogeneity of the smart devices, the difficulty in automating the user-home interaction, and the poor involvement of the users in the development process of new services and applications still represent very debated issues. So, in this paper, we propose an architecture able to overcome the heterogeneity of smart devices and that can be easily extended to new future technologies. To maximize the User Experience, the proposed architecture automatically manages the environment basing on users-defined rules and on people movements, by exploiting an indoor location service based on Bluetooth Low Energy. Finally, the system also provides a simplified development tool that allows even common users to develop new services for Smart Homes and mobile applications to directly interact with the home environment. As a proof-of-concept, the first development steps are described in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel multipurpose system for creating single smart spaces ((Formula presented.)), a new concept of intelligent environment, that relies on innovative sensors board named smart crickets and an ad hoc proximity strategy; by following the Internet of Things paradigm the proposed system is able to transform a cultural space in a smart cultural environment to enhance the enjoyment and satisfaction of the involved people. To assess the effectiveness of our solution, we have experienced two real case studies, the first one situated within an art exhibition (indoor), and the second one concerning an historical building (outdoor).

abstract = {The indoor localisation problem is more complex than just finding whereabouts of users. Finding positions of users relative to the devices of a smart space is even more important. Unfortunately, configuring such systems manually is a tedious process, requires expert knowledge, and is sensitive to changes in the environment. Moreover, many existing solutions do not take user privacy into account. We propose a new system, called Simultaneous Localisation and Configuration (SLAC), to address the problem of locating devices and users relative to those devices, and combine this problem into a single estimation problem. The SLAC algorithm, based on FastSLAM, is able to locate devices using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of devices and motion data from users. Simulations have been used to show the performance in a controlled environment and the effect of the amount of RSSI updates on the localisation error. Live tests in non-trivial environments showed that we can achieve room level accuracy and that the localisation can be performed in real time. This is all done locally, i.e. running on a user's device, with respect for privacy and without using any prior information of the environment or device locations. Although promising, more work is required to increase accuracy in larger environments and to make the algorithm more robust for environment noise caused by walls and other objects. Existing techniques, e.g. map fusing, can alleviate these problems. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present an approach that incorporates appearance-adaptive models in a particle filter to realize robust visual tracking and recognition algorithms. Tracking needs modeling interframe motion and appearance changes, whereas recognition needs modeling appearance changes between frames and gallery images. In conventional tracking algorithms, the appearance model is either fixed or rapidly changing, and the motion model is simply a random walk with fixed noise variance. Also, the number of particles is typically fixed. All these factors make the visual tracker unstable. To stabilize the tracker, we propose the following modifications: an observation model arising from an adaptive appearance model, an adaptive velocity motion model with adaptive noise variance, and an adaptive number of particles. The adaptive-velocity model is derived using a first-order linear predictor based on the appearance difference between the incoming observation and the previous particle configuration. Occlusion analysis is implemented using robust statistics. Experimental results on tracking visual objects in long outdoor and indoor video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracking algorithm. We then perform simultaneous tracking and recognition by embedding them in a particle filter. For recognition purposes, we model the appearance changes between frames and gallery images by constructing the intra- and extrapersonal spaces. Accurate recognition is achieved when confronted by pose and view variations. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {In recent years, applying RFID technology to develop an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) has become a hot research topic. The most prominent advantage of active RFID IPS comes from its unique identification of different objects in indoor environment. However, certain drawbacks of existing RFID IPSs, such as high cost of RFID readers and active tags, as well as heavy dependence on the density of reference tags to provide the location based service, largely limit the applications of active RFID IPS. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we develop a cost-efficient RFID IPS by using cheaper active RFID tags, sensors and reader. In addition, one localization algorithm: integrated Weighted Path Loss (WPL) - Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which combines the fast estimation of WPL and the high localization accuracy of ELM is proposed. According to the algorithm, an indoor environment is divided into small zones firstly and an ELM model is developed for each zone during the offline phase. During the online phase, the WPL approach is used to determine the zone of the target primarily, then the ELM model of that zone is deployed to provide the final estimated location of the target. Based on our experimental result, this integrated algorithm provides a higher localization efficiency and accuracy than existing approaches. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Being able to track the location of a Wi-Fi or Radio Frequency Identification device could improve the quality of services in various sectors, including security, warehouse, logistic management, and healthcare. As compared with outdoor environment, positioning systems face a greater challenge in indoor environment because wireless signal is significantly influenced by building layout and surrounding objects, for which a location fingerprinting approach is needed. Moreover, the signal strength of a wireless device may also change over time, which is known as temporal variation, and therefore a reliable location estimation system must have the ability to learn and adapt with temporal changes. However, if the learning process is highly complex and requires long processing time, deploying the system into a larger scale would not be feasible. In recent years, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has surfaced as a viable alternative that challenged the norm of iterative and progressive learning. ELM has also been considered as a solution for indoor location fingerprinting. However, there has not been a comprehensive review on how the ELM-based approaches are linked with existing location fingerprinting techniques. Here we discuss some major location fingerprinting techniques, which are nearest-neighbor, LANDMARC, and LEMT, and formulate a new framework for systematically translating the techniques into ELM-based methods. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Key challenges to widespread deployment of mobile robots include collaboration and the ability to tailor sensing and information processing to the task at hand. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which are an instance of probabilistic sequential decision-making, can be used to address these challenges in domains characterized by partial observability and nondeterministic action outcomes. However, such formulations tend to be computationally intractable for domains that have large complex state spaces and require robots to respond to dynamic changes. This paper presents a hierarchical decomposition of POMDPs that incorporates adaptive observation functions, constrained convolutional policies, and automatic belief propagation, enabling robots to retain capabilities for different tasks, direct sensing to relevant locations, and determine the sequence of sensing and processing algorithms best suited to any given task. A communication layer is added to the POMDP hierarchy for belief sharing and collaboration in a team of robots. All algorithms are evaluated in simulation and on physical robots, localizing target objects in dynamic indoor domains. {\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {3D reconstruction has been widely used in many important applications. While extensive research has been done in 3D reconstruction, several key issues are still open and the precision of the recovered regions is still far from satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to selecting regions of interest in video frames by analyzing multiple spatio-temporal characteristics and reconstructing 3D objects based on the selected regions. Firstly, the static, location and motion attention are extracted from video frames to generate saliency maps. Then, all the video frames are clustered and a candidate set of key frames is extracted based on the saliency maps, where the key frames are extracted according to the constraints in terms of geometry and visibility. Finally, the 3D structure of the attention region is recovered using the selected key frames and the generated saliency maps. The experiments on realworld indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate that the proposed approach is both more accurate (better attention regions) and computationally more efficient. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Enabling the pervasive paradigm requires the incorporation of location information. Retrieving location data has been a field of ongoing research for both the outdoor and indoor wireless systems. The results in the cellular scenario are already mature and location architectures have been standardized. Recent research is ongoing for indoor-positioning mechanisms, resulting in implementations that vary. A platform that enables the deployment of location-based services in heterogeneous indoor and WLAN-based communication systems will address difficulties in cooperating with different positioning systems. For that purpose, we have designed a novel entity, called Gateway WLAN Location Center (GWLC), which hides the heterogeneous functions of the indoor positioning architectures, incorporating a unified framework for retrieving location data of users and objects. The GWLC platform has been designed to meet objectives such as modularity, scalability, as well as portability, and to facilitate open interfaces. In this contribution, we elaborate on the design principles and the functionality of GWLC. We also provide performance results, obtained through real experiments.

abstract = {Continuous tracking of the device location in 3D space is a popular form of user input, especially for virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), video games and health rehabilitation. Conventional inertial based approaches are well known for inaccuracy caused by large error drifts. Computer vision approaches can produce accuracy tracking but have privacy concerns and are subject to lighting conditions and computation complexity. Recent work exploits accurate acoustic distance measurements for high precision tracking. However, they require additional hardware (e.g., multiple external speakers), which adds to the costs and installation efforts, thus limiting the convenience and usability. In this paper, we propose BatTracker, which incorporates inertial and acoustic data for robust, high precision and infrastructure-free tracking in indoor environments. BatTracker leverages echoes from nearby objects and uses distance measurements from them to correct error accumulation in inertial based device position prediction. It incorporates Doppler shifts and echo amplitudes to reliably identify the association between echoes and objects despite noisy signals from multi-path reflection and cluttered environment. A probabilistic algorithm creates, prunes and evolves multiple hypotheses based on measurement evidences to accommodate uncertainty in device position. Experiments in real environments show that BatTracker can track a mobile device's movements in 3D space at sub-cm level accuracy, comparable to the state-of-the-art infrastructure based approaches, while eliminating the needs of any additional hardware. {\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract = {LED-ID wireless communication channel suffers from much impairment such as shadowing, rapid movement of reader in the home environment. In a LED-ID network environment, multiple propagation paths often exist from a Tag to a reader due to scattering by different objects. Signal copies following different paths can undergo different attenuation, distortions, delays and phase shifts. So, this is necessary to reduce the problem of fading, but not at the cost of extra power or additional bandwidth. One effective solution is proposed for LED-ID system named diversity, without the requirement of power or extra bandwidth. LED-ID system typically needs line of sight (LOS) to support narrow FOV transceivers links to achieve high data rate with sacrifice the coverage. In indoor case link blockage can happen due to the people or other obstacle. Site diversity is one of the solutions to handle this kind of shadowing. In this paper we propose a location based reconfigurable cell site diversity technique for LED-ID system. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {There has been a growing interest in equipping the objects and environment surrounding the user with sensing capabilities. Smart indoor spaces such as smart homes and offices can implement the sensing and processing functionality, relieving users from the need of wearing or carrying smart devices. Enabling such smart spaces requires device-free effortless sensing of user's identity and activities. Device-free sensing using WiFi has shown great potential in such scenarios, however, fundamental questions such as person identification have remained unsolved. In this paper, we present WiWho, a framework that can identify a person from a small group of people in a device-free manner using WiFi. We show that Channel State Information (CSI) used in recent WiFi can identify a person's steps and walking gait. The walking gait being distinguishing characteristics for different people, WiWho uses CSI-based gait for person identification. We demonstrate how step and walk analysis can be used to identify a person's walking gait from CSI, and how this information can be used to identify a person. WiWho does not require a person to carry any device and is effortless since it only requires the person to walk for a few steps (e.g. entering a home or an office). We evaluate WiWho using experiments at multiple locations with a total of 20 volunteers, and show that it can identify a person with average accuracy of 92{\%} to 80{\%} from a group of 2 to 6 people. We also show that in most cases walking as few as 2-3 meters is sufficient to recognize a person's gait and identify the person. We discuss the potential and challenges of WiFi- based person identification with respect to smart space applications. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Whenever an abandoned object is detected, the system is able to determine the video-shot in which a particular object (layer) appears in the guarded environment, from the first frame in which that object enters in the scene to the frame in which the object has been left. The semantic information related on both the dangerous object and the person who left it, allows the system to perform the video-shot detection and indexing tasks. What is important in a video-shot is the information related to the dangerous object present in it. For this reason a video-shot has a two level indexing: the first one is related to the characteristics of the video-shot and the second one is related to the characteristics of a particular layer.},

However, there still lacks an indoor localization solution that can answer the needs of various location-based IoT applications with desired simplicity, robustness, accuracy, and responsiveness. We introduce Foglight, a visible light enabled indoor localization system for IoT devices that relies on unique spatial encoding produced when mechanical mirrors inside a projector are flipped based on gray-coded binary images. Foglight employs simple off-the-shelf light sensors that can be easily coupled with existing IoT devices-such as thermometers, gas meters, or light switches-making their location discoverable. Our sensor unit is computation efficient; it can perform high-accuracy localization with minimum signal processing overhead, allowing any low-power IoT device on which it rests to be able to locate itself. Additionally, results from our evaluation reveal that Foglight can locate a target device with an average accuracy of 1.7 mm and average refresh rate of 84 Hz with minimal latency, 31.46 ms on Wi-Fi and 23.2 ms on serial communication. Two example applications are developed to demonstrate possible scenarios as proof of concept. We also discuss limitations, how they could be overcome, and propose next steps. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Moving objects databases should be able to manage trips that pass through several real world environments, e. g., road network, indoor. However, the current data models only deal with the movement in one situation and cannot represent comprehensive trips for humans who can move inside a building, walk on the pavement, drive on the road, take the public vehicles (bus or train), etc. As a result, existing queries are solely limited to one environment. In this paper, we design a data model that is able to represent moving objects in multiple environments in order to support novel queries on trips in different surroundings and various transportation modes (e. g., Car, Walk, Bus). A generic and precise location representation is proposed that can apply in all environments. The idea is to let the space for moving objects be covered by a set of so-called infrastructures each of which corresponds to an environment and defines the available places for moving objects. Then, the location is represented by referencing to the infrastructure. We formulate the concept of space and infrastructure and propose the methodology to represent moving objects in different environments with the integration of precise transportation modes. Due to different infrastructure characteristics, a set of novel data types is defined to represent infrastructure components. To efficiently support new queries, we design a group of operators to access the data. We present how such a data model is implemented in a database system and report the experimental results. The new model is designed with attention to the data models of previous work for free space and road networks to have a consistent type system and framework of operators. In this way, a powerful set of generic query operations is available for querying, together with those dealing with infrastructures and transportation modes. We demonstrate these capabilities by formulating a set of sophisticated queries across all infrastructures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Many pervasive computing applications depend upon maps for navigation and support of location based services. Maps are commonly available for outdoor pervasive applications from a variety of sources. An individual can determine their location outdoors on these maps via GPS. Indoor pervasive applications may also need to know the layout of rooms, doorways and hallways of buildings, and the objects and obstacles within them, however indoor maps of buildings are less prevalent. Moreover, indoor maps may need to be dynamic and updated regularly since the layout changes when objects and obstacles are added or removed by people within the building. In this paper, we present iFrame, a dynamic approach that leverages existing mobile sensing capabilities for constructing indoor floor plans. We explore how iFrame users may collaborate and contribute to constructing 2-dimensional indoor maps by merely carrying smartphones or other mobile devices, and to allow their mobile devices to share information with other users' devices. The iFrame approach consists of four steps: 1) Abstract the unknown indoor map as a matrix; 2) Leverage collaborating mobile devices that incorporate three mobile sensing technologies - accelerometers to support dead reckoning, Bluetooth RSSI detection, and WiFi RSSI detection; 3) Combine the three methods by Curve Fit Fusion (CFF), and 4) Extend iFrame from one room to a whole building by shadow rates and anchor points analysis. We conducted a deployment study that shows iFrame is a light-weight and unattended approach that provides a skeleton map of a real building effectively and automatically. The layouts of 12 rooms are reconstructed within 5-10 minutes. Changes of layout in indoor maps can be detected and the resolution of the reconstructed indoor floor plans can be improved when there is an increase in the number of cooperating users. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Computer vision is challenging because it is the computer that decides how to act based on an understanding of the image. Key image understanding tasks include depth computation, as well as object detection, localization, recognition and tracking. Techniques up to now have not been able to perform any of these tasks robustly with the precision and accuracy demanded by many real-world applications. Additional complications include operational and environmental factors. For humans, visual recognition is fast and accurate, yet robust against occlusion, clutter, viewpoint variations, and changes in lighting conditions. Moreover, learning new categories requires minimal supervision and a very small set of exemplars. Achieving this level of performance in a wearable portable system would enable a great number of useful applications especially for enhancing mobile cell phone and camera operation. We demonstrate some of the computer vision techniques that we have developed and tested in real environments for applications in the field of automotive navigation, personal navigation, assistive devices and augmented reality. Some of the techniques include object detection and recognition, depth from motion, context recognition and the general task of mapping and localization. Our object detection techniques have shown to have performance close to 100{\%}. We have actually shown that we can triangulate based on objects in the environment using only a camera; which can aid when GPS drops out such as in urban canyons and indoor environments.

abstract = {Due to the popularity of location-based services, determining the location of a device at all times has become a subject of great interests. Although many GPS-based applications have been developed and successfully deployed in various fields, their applicabilities are hindered by the obstruction of the objects in the environment. Essentially, as satellite signals cannot penetrate the walls of buildings, the coverage of GPS systems is limited to outdoor environments. To fully exploit the benefit of location-based services, approaches that determine the location of a device in indoor environments need to be established. This study presents a novel location determination mechanism that uses an indoor WLAN and back-propagation neural network (BPN). A museum is taken as the context of the example indoor environment. Location determination is achieved using the combined strengths of 802.11b wireless access signals. With a significant number of access points (APs) installed in the museum, hand-held devices can sense the strengths of the signals from all APs to which the devices can connect. Using a back-propagation network, device locations can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. A novel adaptive algorithm is implemented for enhancing the accuracy of the estimation. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

abstract = {Understanding indoor scene structure from a single RGB image is useful for a wide variety of applications ranging from the editing of scenes to the mining of statistics about space utilization. Most efforts in scene understanding focus on extraction of either dense information such as pixel-level depth or semantic labels, or very sparse information such as bounding boxes obtained through object detection. In this paper we propose the concept of a scene map, a coarse scene representation, which describes the locations of the objects present in the scene from a top-down view (i.e., as they are positioned on the floor), as well as a pipeline to extract such a map from a single RGB image. To this end, we use a synthetic rendering pipeline, which supplies an adapted CNN with virtually unlimited training data. We quantitatively evaluate our results, showing that we clearly outperform a dense baseline approach, and argue that scene maps provide a useful representation for abstract indoor scene understanding. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s) Eurographics Proceedings {\textcopyright} 2016 The Eurographics Association.},

The first part of the paper describes our methodology towards the construction of the Augmented Reality Game for enhancing astronomy learning in children, emphasizing the experiential nature of tangible interactions and the remote dimension which the game can take, due to the available social media tools, by bringing people into a virtual 3D space to interact with each other. To keep the game simple and less complicated, we employ Single Access Point based Indoor Localization technique for tracking players. In the latter part of the paper we discuss the Indoor Localization system being implemented to track real time location of the player in his/her physical environment and the same being mapped on a virtual game arena for facilitating remote play dimension. Technologies used for early prototype: - basic optics for creating a device that gives 3D illusion of celestial objects appearing on 2D screen, a Kinect-sensor environment, and potentiometer for interactions.

In this study, we explore the potential of passive RFID systems for indoor localization by developing a grid-based experimental framework using two standard and easily measurable performance metrics: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and tag read count (TRC). We create scenarios imitating real life challenges such as placing metal objects and other RFID tags in two different read fields (symmetric and asymmetric) to analyze their impacts on location accuracy. We study the prediction potential of RSSI and TRC both independently and collaboratively. In the end, we demonstrate that both signal metrics can be used for localization with sufficient accuracy whereas the best performance is obtained when both metrics are used together for prediction on an artificial neural network especially for more challenging scenarios. Experimental results show an average error of as low as 0.286 (where consecutive grid distance is defined as unity) which satisfies the grid-based localization benchmark of less than 0.5. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

Nowadays mobile phones are being used to control different devices and access information/services related to those devices. To facilitate such interaction, devices are usually marked with RFID tags or visual markers, which are read by a mobile phone equipped with an integrated RFID reader or camera to fetch related information about those objects and initiate further actions. This article contributes in this domain of mobile physical interaction; however, using a spatial-geometric approach for interacting with indoor physical objects and artifacts instead of RFID based solutions. Using this approach, a mobile phone can point from a distance to an annotated object or a spatial subregion of that object for the purpose of interaction. The pointing direction and location is determined based on the fusion of IR camera and accelerometer data, where the IR cameras are used to calculate the 3D position of the mobile phone users and the accelerometer in the phone provides its tilting and orientation information. The annotation of objects and their subregions with which the mobile phone interacts is performed by specifying their geometric coordinates and associating related information or services with them.We perform experiment in a technology-augmented smart space and show the applicability and potential of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

The recognition of object from a sequence image is difficult due to the change in object's shape, orientation, motion and size between frames. Objects may contain several parts with motion variation. Moving objects show a wide range of color variation due to the angle of view, illumination change, and reflectance from neighbor objects. Thus, to overcome these limitations, we make efficient use of edge-segments utilizing a Canny edge detector. Moving edge-segments are grouped by means of a iterative k-means clustering algorithm and the group is used in the Generalized Hough Transform based shape matching algorithm due to its robustness to utilize partial information. A Kalman filter is then used to predict the location of each group in future frames. Experiments with outdoor and indoor image sequences show encouraging result under varying illumination conditions with partial occlusion. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based systems, have been widely used in different applications in construction and maintenance. This paper investigates the usage of active RFID technology for the localization of movable objects (e.g. material, equipment, tools, and assets) equipped with RFID tags using handheld readers. The method builds on Cluster-based Movable Tag Localization (CMTL) technique which uses k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. CMTL uses multidimensional clustering technique that considers signal pattern similarity between target and reference tags together with spatial distribution of reference tags for detecting the region where the target tag is located. This paper proposes applying an irregular bilinear interpolation method to form a grid of virtual reference tags within the selected cluster of real reference tags. Moreover, the proposed method uses artificial neural networks (ANN) for positioning the target tag, as opposed to empirical weighted averaging formulas used in similar k-NN based methods. Comparative analysis is performed to quantify the improvement of the proposed method over similar k-NN-based methods using a simulation environment. A case study is performed to analyze the performance of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {RFID (radio frequency identification) technology has been widely used for object tracking in many real-life applications, such as inventory monitoring and product flow tracking. These applications usually rely on passive RFID technologies rather than active ones, since passive RFID tags are more attractive than active ones in many aspects, such as lower tag cost and simpler maintenance. RFID technology is also important for indoor location tracking systems that require high degree of accuracy. However, most existing systems estimate object locations by using active RFID tags, which usually incur localization error of more than one meter. Although recent studies begin to investigate the application of passive tags for indoor location tracking, these methods are far from deployable and research of this application is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a new indoor location tracking system, named PassTrack, which relies on the read rates of passive RFID tags for location estimation. PassTrack is designed to tolerate noise arising from external environmental factors, by probabilistically modeling the relationship between tag read rate and tag-reader distance, and updating the model parameters based on the current readings of reference tags. Besides tolerance of noise, PassTrack is also outstanding in terms of localization accuracy and efficiency. Several new approaches for location inference are supported by PassTrack, and the best one incurs an average error of around 30 cm, and is able to carry out over 7500 location estimations per second on an ordinary machine. Furthermore, as a result of using passive RFID tags, PassTrack also enjoys the many other benefits of passive RFID tags mentioned before. We have conducted extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets, which demonstrate that our PassTrack system outperforms the previous localization approaches in localization accuracy, tracking efficiency and space applicability. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

Second, in order to obtain the location-invariant feature of the same target in the images with various cameras, the camera calibration is completed based on a three-dimension (3D) model. After that, for all images via multiple cameras, the coordinates of the 3D model are unified. Finally, referring to the assumption of spatial and temporal consistency of the target location across multiple cameras, the association among detected objects for the same target with different cameras is established. And a feature pool is built which contains perspective and scale features. Thus the same target is continuously tracked across multiple lenses. At last, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with KSP and PABC and demonstrated with indoor and outdoor experiments. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Instead, we take into account holistic contextual 3D information, exploiting the fact that objects in indoor scenes co-occur mostly in typical configurations. First, we use a neural network trained on real indoor annotated images to extract 2D keypoints, and feed them to a 3D candidate object generation stage. Then, we solve a global selection problem among these candidates using pairwise co-occurrence statistics discovered from a large 3D scene database. We iterate the process allowing for candidates with low keypoint response to be incrementally detected based on the location of the already discovered nearby objects. We demonstrate significant performance improvement over combinations of state-of-the-art methods, especially for scenes with moderately to severely occluded objects. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present here SIMPLIcity (Semantics-sensitive Integrated Matching for Picture LIbraries), an image retrieval system using semantics classification and integrated region matching (IRM) based upon image segmentation. The SIMPLIcity system represents an image by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into categories which are intended to distinguish semantically meaningful difierences, such as textured versus nontextured, indoor versus outdoor, and graph versus photograph. Retrieval is enhanced by narrowing down the searching range in a database to a particular category and exploiting semantically-adaptive searching methods. A measure for the overall similarity between images, the IRM distance, is defined by a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. This overall similarity approach reduces the adverse effect of inaccurate segmentation, helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region, and enables a simple querying interface for region-based image retrieval systems. The application of SIMPLIcity to a database of about 200,000 general-purpose images demonstrates accurate retrieval at high speed. The system is also robust to image alterations. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

abstract = {In the traditional indoor positioning systems, because of high cost or various environmental interferences, most existing technology such as GPS, Bluetooth and RFID are not so useful. Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) is a kind of low-cost location positioning technique that can get high accuracy by estimating the heading angle of target from acceleration, gyro and compass data. Usually, researchers use compass data to estimate heading angle. However, the compass data is easily affected by external environment, such as electrical equipment or some objects made by iron or steel. On the other hand, the calculation results by the obtained data of acceleration and gyro usually have accumulated error with time. When time comes longer, the bigger error often appears. Some researchers use Wi-Fi based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to assist PDR for correction. However, some Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) cannot be used because RSSI can be affected by external factors, such as people moving, wall. In this paper, a novel method that can improve PDR by heading correction is proposed. In this method, heading angle is estimated by calculating the yaw angle with Quaternion from acceleration and gyro data, and optimal APs selection method is used to select suitable RSSI for getting high accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Society of Instrument and Control Engineers - SICE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel coarse-to-fine global localization approach inspired by object recognition and text retrieval techniques. Harris-Laplace interest points characterized by scale-invariant transformation feature descriptors are used as natural landmarks. They are indexed into two databases: a location vector space model (LVSM) and a location database. The localization process consists of two stages: coarse localization and fine localization. Coarse localization from the LVSM is fast, but not accurate enough, whereas localization from the location database using a voting algorithm is relatively slow, but more accurate. The integration of coarse and fine stages makes fast and reliable localization possible. If necessary, the localization result can be verified by epipolar geometry between the representative view in the database and the view to be localized. In addition, the localization system recovers the position of the camera by essential matrix decomposition. The localization system has been tested in indoor and outdoor environments. The results show that our approach is efficient and reliable. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Object proposal detection is an effective way of accelerating object recognition. Existing proposal methods are mostly based on detecting object boundaries, which may not be effective for cluttered backgrounds. In this paper, we leverage stereopsis as a robust and effective solution for generating object proposals. We first obtain a set of candidate bounding boxes through adaptive transformation, which fits the bounding boxes tightly to object boundaries detected by rough depth and color information. A two-level hierarchy composed of proposal and cluster levels is then constructed to estimate object locations in an efficient and accurate manner. Three stereo-based cues 'exactness,' 'focus,' and 'distribution' are proposed for objectness estimation. Two-level hierarchical ranking is proposed to accurately obtain ranked object proposals. A stereo data set with 400 labeled stereo image pairs is constructed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in both indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed stereo-based approach achieves a better performance than the state of the arts with either a small or a large number of object proposals. As stereopsis can be a complement to the color information, the proposed method can be integrated with existing proposal methods to obtain superior results. {\textcopyright} 1992-2012 IEEE.},

A novel tag-free solution is presented that utilizes low cost wall-mounted ultrasonic transducers. The active ultrasonic transducers capture analog echoes, which are then digitized and analyzed in order to calculate the 1-D range of the moving person. The tracking algorithm utilizes a number of signal processing techniques including band-pass filtering, Hilbert transformation, and back-ground subtraction to remove interference from other objects in the room. The range data from multiple sensors are treated as observations in a Bayesian framework using the sigma-point Kalman smoother (SPKS) to determine a person's 2-D position and velocity. The SPKS also performs "self-calibration" or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to determine the location of the wall-mounted transducers. The indoor tracking accuracy of the tag-free system is better than 0.5 meters. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Image-based object recognition is employed widely in many computer vision applications such as image semantic annotation and object location. However, traditional object recognition algorithms based on the 2D features of RGB data have difficulty when objects overlap and image occlusion occurs. At present, RGB-D cameras are being used more widely and the RGB-D depth data can provide auxiliary information to address these challenges. In this study, we propose a deep learning approach for the efficient recognition of 3D objects with occlusion. First, this approach constructs a multi-view shape model based on 3D objects by using an encode-decode deep learning network to represent the features. Next, 3D object recognition in indoor scenes is performed using random forests. The application of deep learning to RGB-D data is beneficial for recovering missing information due to image occlusion. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the efficiency of feature representation and the performance of object recognition with occlusion. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This indoor positioning system can be applied to the location detection of a moving object such as a person or a goods trolley over a wide indoor area. The proposed system works by means of ultrasonic signals. This makes it easy to avoid multipath effects because the propagation velocity of ultrasonic signals is much slower than that of radio waves. In addition, ultrasonic signals are not restricted by radio regulations that may differ from country to country. The main feature of our system, developed and presented last year, is that it does not require synchronization between the transmitting and receiving units. This paper describes a system for accommodating multiple moving objects and expanding positioning area. Two techniques, the allocation of a specific ID to each positioning object and the use of a virtual receiving point for ultrasonic signals, were investigated in order to realize the required functions and make the proposed system more practical. The effectiveness of these techniques was confirmed by experiments carried out using ultrasonic sensors installed in the ceiling and model railway trains acting as moving objects on the floor below. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Our goal is to create a visual odometry system for robots and wearable systems such that localization accuracies of centimeters can be obtained for hundreds of meters of distance traveled. Existing systems have achieved approximately a 1{\%} to 5{\%} localization error rate whereas our proposed system achieves close to 0.1{\%} error rate, a ten-fold reduction. Traditional visual odometry systems drift over time as the frame-to-frame errors accumulate. In this paper, we propose to improve visual odometry using visual landmarks in the scene. First, a dynamic local landmark tracking technique is proposed to track a set of local landmarks across image frames and select an optimal set of tracked local landmarks for pose computation. As a result, the error associated with each pose computation is minimized to reduce the drift significantly. Second, a global landmark based drift correction technique is proposed to recognize previously visited locations and use them to correct drift accumulated during motion. At each visited location along the route, a set of distinctive visual landmarks is automatically extracted and inserted into a landmark database dynamically. We integrate the landmark based approach into a navigation system with 2 stereo pairs and a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for increased robustness. We demonstrate that a real-time visual odometry system using local and global landmarks can precisely locate a user within 1 meter over 1000 meters in unknown indoor/outdoor environments with challenging situations such as climbing stairs, opening doors, moving foreground objects etc.. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The process of generating schematic maps of salient objects from a set of pictures of an indoor environment is challenging. It has been an active area of research as it is crucial to a wide range of context- And locationaware services, as well as for general scene understanding. Although many automated systems have been developed to solve the problem, most of them either require predefining labels or expensive equipment, such as RGBD sensors or lasers, to scan the environment. In this article, we introduce a prototype system to show how human computations can be utilized to generate schematic maps from a set of pictures, without making strong assumptions or demanding extra devices. The system requires humans (crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turks) to do simple spatial mapping tasks in various conditions, and their data are aggregated by filtering and clustering techniques that allow salient cues to be identified in the pictures and their spatial relations to be inferred and projected on a two-dimensional map. In particular, we tested and demonstrated the effectiveness of two methods that improved the quality of the generated schematic map: (1) We encouraged humans to adopt an allocentric representations of salient objects by guiding them to perform mental rotations of these objects and (2) we sensitized human perception by guided arrows superimposed on the imagery to improve the accuracy of depth and width estimation. We demonstrated the feasibility of our system by evaluating the results of schematic maps generated from indoor pictures taken from an office building. By calculating Riemannian shape distances between the generated maps to the ground truth, we found that the generated schematic maps captured the spatial relations well. Our results showed that the combination of human computations and machine clustering could lead to more-accurate schematized maps from imagery.We also discuss how our approach may have important insights on methods that leverage human computations in other areas. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

In the area of activity recognition (AR) authors use different kind of sensors such as smart floors, binary sensors attached to common objects, or infer the proximity to objects using Bluetooth beacons. In this paper we want to join these two different field approaches (IPIN and AR) by proposing an indoor localization method that make use of smart floor information, binary sensors, and the signal strength received at a smartwatch coming from BLE beacons deployed in a smarlab. We use the smart floor as a ground truth in order to estimate location accuracy of persons in a totally unobtrusive way. The localization results, for a person moving in the smart livinglab during 10 days, showing accuracies below 1.5 meter in 80{\%} of the cases. The proposed approach can help the tracking of multiple persons living together and also serve as a complement to improve the performance of location-aware activity recognition algorithms, {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

Although Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely used for navigation in numerous applications, it cannot be used for indoor navigation systems as the signals cannot be absorbed by the walls of buildings. As a result, other methods including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sensors must be used for navigation. This paper analyses the various algorithms used to find the location of objects and algorithms to navigate using the shortest path in an indoor environment. The first section introduces indoor navigation systems, the problem statement of this paper, and the background of such systems. Then, a comprehensive literature review is included that reviews previous research studies conducted in this area. After that, a discussion and analysis of the literature review has been done to classify and compare between the algorithms and techniques studied. Finally, the paper provides directions for future work in the field of indoor navigation. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

In this paper, we have proposed CROWD-PAN-360 (CP360), a novel smartphone-based system to generate 360-degree panoramic map of a querying user for his unfamiliar surrounding using crowd-sourced images. The objects (logical locations) appearing in the images are identified using manually or automatically generated tags. The system is context-aware and it intelligently associates user location coordinates with several smartphone contexts, like acceleration and orientation. CP360 can significantly reduce GPS positional errors for even cheap low-end smartphones and can identify the user surroundings very efficiently. We extensively tested the system in both indoor and outdoor environments of IIT Roorkee campus using Android smartphones over a dataset of more than 6,000 crowd-sourced images of nearly 70 objects (departments, hostels, cafeteria, etc.) and CP360 generates the panoramic map with an average accuracy of 92.2 percent. {\textcopyright} 1990-2012 IEEE.},

The same is, however, not the case for indoor environments, where access is often restricted and the spaces are cluttered. Further, such environments typically contain a high density of repeated objects (e.g., tables, chairs, monitors, etc.) in regular or non-regular arrangements with significant pose variations and articulations. In this paper, we exploit the special structure of indoor environments to accelerate their 3D acquisition and recognition with a low-end handheld scanner. Our approach runs in two phases: (i) a learning phase wherein we acquire 3D models of frequently occurring objects and capture their variability modes from only a few scans, and (ii) a recognition phase wherein from a single scan of a new area, we identify previously seen objects but in different poses and locations at an average recognition time of 200ms/model. We evaluate the robustness and limits of the proposed recognition system using a range of synthetic and real world scans under challenging settings. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

Many studies show that natural walking in virtual environments increases the feeling of immersion by the users. However, most tracking systems suffer from a limited working area or are expensive to scale up to a reasonable size for navigation. Our system is designed to be easily scalable both in working area and number of simultaneous users using inexpensive off-the-shelf components. To accomplish this, the system determines the 6 DOF pose using passive LED strips, mounted to the ceiling, which are spatially encoded using De Bruijn codes. A camera mounted to the head of the user records these patterns. The camera can determine its own pose independently, so no restriction on the number of tracked objects is required. The system is accurate to a few millimeters in location and less than a degree in orientation. The accuracy of the tracker is furthermore independent of the size of the working area which makes it scalable to enormous installations. To provide a realistic feeling of immersion, the system is developed to be realtime and is only limited by the framerate of the camera, currently at 60Hz.},

To achieve this, each 3D model is represented as a group of view-dependent representations generated from a set of synthesized views. We iteratively conduct object segmentation and 3D model retrieval, based on the observation that good segmentation of the objects of interest can significantly improve the accuracy of model retrieval and make it robust to cluttered background and occlusion, and in turn, the retrieved models can be used to assist with segmentation. Segmentation of all objects of interest is achieved simultaneously under a unified multi-labeling framework which fully utilizes the correspondences between the objects and retrieved model images. Besides, we propose a new method to estimate the scene layout of the input image, which helps compose the resulting scene and further improves the modeling result.

abstract = {Knowing popular indoor locations can benefit many applications like exhibition planning and location-based advertising, among others. In this work, we use uncertain historical indoor mobility data to find the top-k popular indoor semantic locations with the highest flow values. In the data we use, an object positioning report contains a set of samples, each consisting of an indoor location and a corresponding probability. The problem is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable flow values and the heavy computational workload on probabilistic samples for large numbers of objects. To address the first challenge, we propose an indoor flow definition that takes into account both data uncertainty and indoor topology. To efficiently compute flows for individual indoor semantic locations, we design data structures for facilitating accessing the relevant data, a data reduction method that reduces the intermediate data to process, and an overall flow computing algorithm. Furthermore, we design search algorithms for finding the top-k popular indoor semantic locations. All proposals are evaluated extensively on real and synthetic data. The evaluation results show that our data reduction method significantly reduces the data volume in computing, our search algorithms are efficient and scalable, and the top-k popular semantic locations returned are in good accord with ground truth.

Task planning in such environments involves sequencing the robot's high-level goals and subgoals, and typically requires reasoning about the locations of people, rooms, and objects in the environment, and their interactions to achieve a goal. One of the prerequisites for optimal task planning that is often overlooked is having an accurate estimate of the actual distance (or time) a robot needs to navigate from one location to another. Stateof-ihe-art mot ion planners, though often computationally complex, are designed exactly for this pUrpose of finding routes through constrained spaces. In this work, we focus on integrating task and motion planning (TMP) to achieve task-level optimal planning for robot navigation while maintaining manageable computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce TMP algorithm PETLON (Planning Efficiently for Task-Level-Optimal Navigation) for everyday service tasks using a mobile robot. PETLON is more efficient than planning approaches that pre-compute motion costs of all possible navigation actions, while still producing plans that are optimal at the task level. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.},

To organize a heterogeneous scene collection, we cluster the scenes based on a set of extracted focal points: scenes in a cluster are closely connected when viewed from the perspective of the representative focal points of that cluster. The key concept of representativity requires that the focal points occur frequently in the cluster and that they result in a compact cluster. Hence, the problem of focal point extraction is intermixed with the problem of clustering groups of scenes based on their representative focal points. We present a co-analysis algorithm which interleaves frequent pattern mining and subspace clustering to extract a set of contextual focal points which guide the clustering of the scene collection. We demonstrate advantages of focal-centric scene comparison and organization over existing approaches, particularly in dealing with hybrid scenes, scenes consisting of elements which suggest membership in different semantic categories.

abstract = {Fine time resolution enables ultrawideband (UWB) ranging systems to extract the first multipath arrival corresponding to the range between a transmitter and receiver, even when attenuated in strength compared to later arrivals. Bearing systems alone lack any notion of time and in general select the strongest arrival which is rarely the first one in nonline-of-sight conditions. Complementing UWB ranging systems with bearing capabilities allows indexing the arrivals as a function of both time and angle in order to isolate the first, providing precision range and angle. However, that precision degrades with the increasing presence of walls and other objects which distort the properties of the first arrival. In order to gauge the physical limits of the joint UWB system, we design and assemble a spatial-temporal channel sounder using a vector network analyzer coupled to a virtual antenna array, and conduct 200 experiments to measure the time- and angle-of-flight. The experiments are carried out in both line-of-sight and nonline-of-sight conditions up to an unprecedented 45 meters throughout four separate buildings with dominant wall material varying from sheet rock to steel. In addition, we report performance for varying bandwidth and center frequency of the system. We find that operating at a bandwidth of 4GHz suffices in resolving multipath in most buildings and in excess shows virtually no improvement. While the range error decreases at lower center frequencies, the higher frequencies offer better angular resolution and so smaller angle error.},

In order to find different rooms (i.e. an office, a lab, or a bathroom) and other building amenities (i.e. an exit or an elevator), we incorporate door detection with text recognition. First we develop a robust and efficient algorithm to detect doors and elevators based on general geometric shape, by combining edges and corners. The algorithm is generic enough to handle large intra-class variations of the object model among different indoor environments, as well as small inter-class differences between different objects such as doors and elevators. Next, to distinguish an office door from a bathroom door, we extract and recognize the text information associated with the detected objects. We first extract text regions from indoor signs with multiple colors. Then text character localization and layout analysis of text strings are applied to filter out background interference. The extracted text is recognized by using off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) software products. The object type, orientation, and location can be displayed as speech for blind travelers. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

abstract = {The lack of floor plans is a critical reason behind the current sporadic availability of indoor localization service. Service providers have to go through effort-intensive and timeconsuming business negotiations with building operators, or hire dedicated personnel to gather such data. In this paper, we propose Jigsaw, a floor plan reconstruction system that leverages crowdsensed data from mobile users. It extracts the position, size and orientation information of individual landmark objects from images taken by users. It also obtains the spatial relation between adjacent landmark objects from inertial sensor data, then computes the coordinates and orientations of these objects on an initial floor plan. By combining user mobility traces and locations where images are taken, it produces complete floor plans with hallway connectivity, room sizes and shapes. Our experiments on 3 stories of 2 large shopping malls show that the 90-percentile errors of positions and orientations of landmark objects are about 1 ∼ 2m and 5 ∼ 9°, while the hallway connectivity is 100{\%} correct.

In this paper, we study the problem of detecting anomalous events by analyzing the motion trajectories in videos. Different trajectories of the same category may have varying relative velocities, in addition to the variations and noises in location samples; hence the core of the problem is to provide a robust and accurate function for measuring the similarities of trajectory pairs. We propose a novel learning based algorithm for estimating the similarities of the multi-dimensional sequence pairs, and then an anomaly detection framework is presented to detect anomalous motion trajectories in surveillance videos. Our proposed algorithm offers several advantages over the traditional algorithms for dealing with the trajectories of moving objects. First, the similarity measurement is robust against data imperfections such as noise, algorithmic error and etc. Second, we introduce a learning algorithm which allows the similarity function to be adapted to the particular problems being solved. Third, the proposed anomaly detection framework is fully automatic and without parametric distribution assumption on the data. The experiments on both outdoor and indoor surveillance videos validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in detecting anomalous trajectories. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose an indoor location solution based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a class of learning algorithms defined to resolve discrimination and regression problems. In fact, with many works, it turned out that it is very difficult to properly locate a target with only the RSSI measurements. Thus, the idea is to use multi-class SVM with RSSI measurements to propose a zoning localization approach. The performed experiments using different datasets, collected from two real world environments in both a hospital and a laboratory building, and the comparison with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) confirm the effectiveness of our SVM-based localization proposal.

abstract = {Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a rapidly developing wireless technology with key features which anticipate its outstanding position in the upcoming era of pervasive computing. Even though object identification is its primary objective, it is generally accepted that RFID systems can revolutionize various commercial applications. Despite its promising benefits, however, there are some technological challenges that should be addressed in order to exploit the full potential of RFID. Admittedly, the interference problem among its components and from non-conductive materials is the main shortcoming of RFID. The main goal of this paper is exploring its applicability for indoor location sensing, an important feature for the realization of ubiquitous computing applications. To that end, we study the impact of several interference types on its performance. Focusing on the case of determining the location of mobile terminals with reader extension by relying on a deployment of tags, we consider three RFID positioning schemes which are easily implemented but differ in their memory and computation requirements. Mathematical models are derived for describing the main interference types and their influence on the accuracy and time response of these schemes. Finally, extensive simulation analysis is conducted for exploring the practicality and efficacy of RFID for the localization of single or multiple users under different levels of environmental harshness. Numerical results validate the potential of RFID in location sensing but also the requirement for careful design of RFID-based positioning systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This way of image taking reduces possible landmark shape occlusion and image noise creation, which come from the existence of nearby objects or humans surrounding the vehicle. It is shown that the perspective shape of the circular landmark in the omni-directional image may be approximated by an ellipse by analytic formulas with good shape-fitting effect and fast computation speed.

We propose a robot design to solve one of these tasks: climbing vertical structures and manipulating objects. Our robot embeds two manipulators that can grasp both objects or structures. To help climbing, it uses a rope to compensate for the gravity force. This allows it to free one of its manipulators to interact with an object while the other grasps a part of a structure for stabilization. Our robot can launch and retrieve the rope autonomously, allowing multiple ascents.

abstract = {Transceiver-free object localization is essential for emerging location-based service, e.g., the safe guard system and asset security. It can track indoor target without carrying any device and has attracted many research effort. Among these technologies, Radio Signal Strength (RSS) based approaches are very popular because of their low-cost and wide applicability. In such work, usually a large number of reference nodes have to be deployed. However, if in a very large area, many labor work to measure the positions of the reference nodes have to be performed, result in not practical in real scenario. In this paper, we propose Double Free, which can accurately track transceiver-free object without measuring the positions of the reference nodes. Users may randomly deploy nodes in a 2D area, e.g., the ceiling of the floor. Our Double Free contains two steps: reference node localization and target localization. The key to achieve the first step is to utilize the RSS difference in different channel to distinguish the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal from combined multiple paths' signal. Thus, the reference nodes can be accurately localized without additional hardware. In the second step, we propose two algorithms: Influential Link {\&} Node (ILN) and MultiPath Distinguishing (MD). ILN is simple to implement, while MD can accurately model the additional signal caused by the target, then accurately localize the target. To implement this idea, 16 TelosB nodes are placed randomly in a 25×10m2 laboratory. The experiment results show, the average localization error is only round 2 meters without requiring to measure the positions of reference nodes in advance. It shows enormous potential in those localization areas, where manual measurement is hard to perform, or hard labor work want to be saved. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

To use our system, the user only needs to drag a few semantic bounding boxes for the query objects. The proposed approach then retrieves the most similar 3D models from the ShapeNet model repository, and aligns them with the corresponding objects automatically. This requires that the 3D models are represented by calibrated view-dependent visual elements learned from the rendered views. With the estimated occlusion relationships, the rendered model images are stacked at the corresponding locations to simulate the scene context. By conducting matching between these synthesized scenes and the input image, the most similar 3D models under the approximate poses are retrieved. Moreover, we show that the retrieving time can be significantly reduced based on a novel greedy algorithm.

We consider the case where the transmitter and receivers can be synchronized, so that time-of-arrival (TOA) instead of time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information can be utilized. Assuming Gaussian errors for the range estimates, we propose a novel, Two-Step, Expectation Maximization (TSEM) based algorithm for the localization of the passive object. This algorithm achieves the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of TOA algorithms. Simulation results show that the error variance of TSEM is much lower (often 30 dB) than that of the existing, TDOA-based, algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel method that utilizes Region-based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) for identifying objects in an image, and then, localizes the image using a pre-stored map of these objects. The algorithm follows the next steps. First, an image, taken by a smart phone, is uploaded to the server, where a pre-trained R-CNN and template images are combined to identify the objects in the image. In the second step, the location of the image is derived according to the spatial relationships of the objects in the image with a prior knowledge of the objects location in a digital map. Finally, if more than one location solutions are obtained from the previous step, a range-based localization method is utilized to eliminate the wrong results. To prove the concept, a test is conducted in typical yet challenging indoor environment. Selected objects were labeled in 600 images, taken randomly around the test environment, to train the R-CNN and used for template matching. Another 42 images, with known capture locations, were utilized to assess the performance of the method. The proposed object-based indoor localization method detected 81.7{\%} of the objects in the images, and provided 59.5{\%} success rate with 1-5 m accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {Doors are a significant object for the visually impaired and robots to enter and exit buildings. Although the accuracy of door detection is reported high in indoor scenes, it has become a difficult problem in outdoor scenes in computer vision. The reason may lie in the fact that such properties of a simple ordinary door such as handles, corners, and the gap between the door and the ground may not be visible due to the great variety of doors in outdoor environments. In this paper, we present a vision-based method for detecting building entrances in outdoor images. After extracting the lines and deleting the extra ones, regions between the vertical lines are specified and the features including height, width, location, color, texture and the number of lines inside the regions are obtained. Finally, some additional knowledge such as door existence at the bottom of the image, a reasonable height and width of a door, the difference between color and texture of the doors and those of the neighboring regions, and numerous lines on doors is used to decide on door detection. The method was tested on the eTRIMS dataset, door images from the ImageNet dataset, and our own dataset including doors of houses, apartments, and stores leading to acceptable results. The obtained results show that our approach outperforms comparable state-of-the-art approaches. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In outdoor scenarios the GPS-System is often used, but not all of the already existing wireless infrastructure is capable of providing the position information needed, especially in indoor environments. For this case several approaches can be found in the literature. Most of them adopt the GPS-principle thus needing additional infrastructure and objects actively participating in the position finding task. We will present a system that is based on doppler measurement and only analyses a relative distance information between the object to be detected and four very basic sensors. Therefore no cooperation of the object is needed which is very important for the mentioned security relevant applications.

The considered environment model consists of a set of local models representing particular locations in the modeled environment. Each local model consists of planar surface segments and line segments representing the edges of objects in the environment. The presented method is designed for indoor and urban environments. A computationally efficient pose hypothesis generation approach is proposed that ranks the features according to their potential contribution to the pose information, thereby reducing the time needed for obtaining accurate pose estimation. Furthermore, a robust probabilistic method for selecting the best pose hypothesis is proposed that allows matching of partially overlapping point clouds with gross outliers. The proposed approach is experimentally tested on a benchmark dataset containing depth images acquired in the indoor environment with changes in lighting conditions and the presence of moving objects.

abstract = {Inexpensive structured light sensors can capture rich information from indoor scenes, and scene labeling problems provide a compelling opportunity to make use of this information. In this paper we present a novel conditional random field (CRF) model to effectively utilize depth information for semantic labeling of indoor scenes. At the core of the model, we propose a novel and efficient plane detection algorithm which is robust to erroneous depth maps. Our CRF formulation defines local, pairwise and higher order interactions between image pixels. At the local level, we propose a novel scheme to combine energies derived from appearance, depth and geometry-based cues. The proposed local energy also encodes the location of each object class by considering the approximate geometry of a scene. For the pairwise interactions, we learn a boundary measure which defines the spatial discontinuity of object classes across an image. To model higher-order interactions, the proposed energy treats smooth surfaces as cliques and encourages all the pixels on a surface to take the same label. We show that the proposed higher-order energies can be decomposed into pairwise sub-modular energies and efficient inference can be made using the graph-cuts algorithm. We follow a systematic approach which uses structured learning to fine-tune the model parameters. We rigorously test our approach on SUN3D and both versions of the NYU-Depth database. Experimental results show that our work achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art scene labeling techniques. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Localization is of great importance in mobile and wireless network applications. TDOA is one of the widely used localization schemes, in which a to-be-located object emits a signal and a number of receivers record the arriving time of the signal. By calculating the time difference of different receivers, the location of the object is estimated. In such a scheme, receivers must be precisely synchronized; even slight noises are completely unacceptable for centimeter-level localization. Previous studies have shown that existing time synchronization approaches for low-cost devices are insufficiently accurate and basically infeasible for high accuracy localization. In our scheme (called Whistle), several asynchronous receivers record a target signal and a successive signal that is generated artificially. By two-signal sensing and sample counting techniques, high time resolution can be achieved. This design fundamentally changes TDOA in the sense of releasing the synchronization requirement and avoiding many sources of inaccuracy. We implement Whistle on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cell phones. Through extensive real-world experiments in indoor and outdoor, quiet and noisy environments, the mean error is 10∼20 centimeters in a 9 × 9 × 4m 3 3D space. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The proposed grid of reader antennas can assist in minimizing the actual number of reader antennas required for RFID large scale deployment. The proposed prototype system is a simpler positioning system which presents the solution of placement pattern of RFID reader antennas, gives less complicated mathematical calculation, and is able to provide a high degree of accuracy. The obtained results show that the proposed location sensing system can achieve better positioning accuracy as compared to existing positioning system and in some cases accuracy improvement of about 50{\%} can be reached. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Moreover, we have deployed in the museum rooms a particular Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that, using Bluetooth technology, is able to sense the surrounding area for detecting user devices' presence. Once a device has been detected, the related MAC address is retrieved and multimedia contents of the closest museum artworks are delivered to user using proper multimedia delivery techniques to facilitate and make more stimulating the visit.

abstract = {Location based services in wireless sensor networks are quite demanding applications especially in indoors, such that accurate localization of objects and people in indoor environments has long been considered as one of important building blocks in wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate sensor location estimation problem where a target sensor measures inconsistent signals as received-signal-strength or time-of-arrival from anchor sensors with known locations, whereas target sensor location must be estimated. We know that even in large scale wireless sensor networks, information are relatively sparse compared with the number of sensors. In such networks, the localization problem can be recast as a sparse signal recovery problem in the discrete spatial domain from a small number of linear measurements by solving an under-determined linear system. By exploiting the compressive sensing theory, sparse signals can be recovered from far fewer samples than Nyquist sampling rate. Our approach uses a few number of inconsistent measurements to find the wireless device location over a non-symmetric spatial grid. In this method, an ℓ 1-norm minimization program is used to recover the wireless user location. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations with synthetic and real measurements. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The existing three-dimensional (3D) object layout methods are focused mainly on indoor scenes and they are limited for outdoor applications. In this study, we propose a data-driven method for outdoor scene modeling by using fast retrieval and automatic optimization layout techniques. Unlike the current methods, we first employ an improved manifold ranking algorithm in the sketch-based 3D model retrieval stage, which achieves higher accuracy. Next, according to the particular properties of outdoor architectures, specialized constraints are then proposed to define an energy function, which meets both the functional and aesthetic requirements. Finally, we cast the auto-arrangement as a combinatorial optimization problem, which we solve using an optimization algorithm. In contrast to the earlier version of this method, which was presented at Cyberworlds 2016, this extended version combines simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization algorithms, which have the advantages of rapid convergence and avoiding becoming trapped by local minima. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more intuitive and effective for modeling 3D scenes, and can be employed in the actual development of game scenes. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

However, in most cases, those techniques assume that the light sources are located at infinity, which cannot be applied to, for example, photometric modeling of indoor environments. In this paper, we propose two methods to estimate the surface reflectance property of an object, as well as the position of a light source from a single image without the distant illumination assumption. Given a color image of an object with specular reflection as an input, the first method estimates the light source position by fitting to the Lambertian diffuse component, while separating the specular and diffuse components by using an iterative relaxation scheme. Moreover, we extend the above method by using a single specular image as an input, thus removing its constraints on the diffuse reflectance property and the number of light sources. This method simultaneously recovers the reflectance properties and the light source positions by optimizing the linearity of a log-transformed Torrance-Sparrow model. By estimating the object's reflectance property and the light source position, we can freely generate synthetic images of the target object under arbitrary source directions and source-surface distances.},

Mobile users use the mobile network indoors about 80{\%} of their time compared to outdoor. To identify coverage gaps it requires precise knowledge about the environment itself and the whereabout of the mobile terminal. This knowledge is lacking for two reasons. First the network driven time-based location solutions of the user is rather inaccurate for reasons like multi-path propagation or inaccurate synchronization. Furthermore, the indoor environment itself remains normally unknown for the network operators. However, the high density of users in indoor environments invites to explicitly use the potential peer-to-peer links between mobile terminals themselves. This would allow to position the mobile terminals relatively to each other. Positioning by using the peer-to-peer link is called cooperative positioning.

abstract = {Object, action, or scene representations that are corrupted by noise significantly impair the performance of visual recognition. Typically, partial occlusion, clutter, or excessive articulation affects only a subset of all feature dimensions and, most importantly, different dimensions are corrupted in different samples. Nevertheless, the common approach to this problem in feature selection and kernel methods is to down-weight or eliminate entire training samples or the same dimensions of all samples. Thus, valuable signal is lost, resulting in suboptimal classification. Our goal is, therefore, to adjust the contribution of individual feature dimensions when comparing any two samples and computing their similarity. Consequently, per-sample selection of informative dimensions is directly integrated into kernel computation. The interrelated problems of learning the parameters of a kernel classifier and determining the informative components of each sample are then addressed in a joint objective function. The approach can be integrated into the learning stage of any kernel-based visual recognition problem and it does not affect the computational performance in the retrieval phase. Experiments on diverse challenges of action recognition in videos and indoor scene classification show the general applicability of the approach and its ability to improve learning of visual representations. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Doors are frequently encountered in structured man-made environments and function as transitions between different places. We adopt a probabilistic approach for door detection, by defining the likelihood of various features for generated door hypotheses. Differing from previous approaches, the proposed model captures both the shape and appearance of the door. This is learned from a few training examples, exploiting additional assumptions about the structure of indoor environments. After the learning stage, we describe a hypothesis generation process and several approaches to evaluate the likelihood of the generated hypotheses. The approach is tested on numerous examples of indoor environment. It shows a good performance provided that the door extent in the images is sufficiently large and well supported by low level feature measurements. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This correction results in objective color measures of the imaged surfaces.

In this paper, we propose a structure-based image completion algorithm for object removal that produces visually plausible content with consistent structure and scene texture. We use an edge matching technique to infer the potential structure of the unknown region. Driven by the estimated structure, texture synthesis is performed automatically along the estimated curves.

In this work we discuss some improvements to the positioning accuracy of the fingerprint-based systems. Our algorithm ranks the information about the location in a hierarchical way by identifying the building, the floor, the room and the geometric position. The proposed fingerprint method uses a previously stored map of the signal strength at several positions and determines the position using similarity functions and majority rules. In particular, we compare different similarity functions to understand their impact on the accuracy of the positioning system. The experimental results confirm the possibility of correctly determining the building, the floor and the room where the persons or the objects are at with high rates, and with an average error around 3 meters. Moreover, detailed statistics about the errors are provided, showing that the average error metric, often used by many authors, hides many aspects on the system performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The scanner is mounted on top of an autonomous mobile robot and serves control purposes. We present results achieved by applying the visual attention system of Itti et al.

abstract = {In recent years, both the RFID and computer vision technologies have been widely employed in indoor scenarios aimed at different goals while faced with respective limitations. For example, the RFID-based EAS system is useful in quickly identifying tagged objects but the accompanying false alarm problem is troublesome and hard to tackle with except that the accurate trajectory of the target tag can be easily acquired. On the other side, the CV system performs fairly well in tracking multiple moving objects precisely while finding it difficult to screen out the specific target among them. To overcome the above limitations, we present TagVision, a hybrid RFID and computer vision system for fine-grained localization and tracking of tagged objects. A fusion algorithm is proposed to organically combine the position information given by the CV subsystem, and phase data output by the RFID subsystem. In addition, we employ the probabilistic model to eliminate the measurement error caused by thermal noise and device diversity. We have implemented TagVision with COTS camera and RFID devices and evaluated it extensively in our lab environment. Experimental results show that TagVision can achieve 98{\%} blob matching accuracy and 10.33mm location tracking precision. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {A moving object database (MODB), a database representing information on moving objects, has many uses in a wide range of applications, such as the digital battlefield and transportation systems. In the transportation system, an MODB processes queries such as "How long should I wait until the next bus arrives here?" Therefore, location information on moving objects reflects the most important data the MODB has to manipulate. Most moving objects are equipped with a GPS (Global Positioning System) unit that sends location information to the MODB. However, GPS signals are usually very weak inside enclosed structures; thus, locating indoor moving objects requires more than the GPS. In this regard, indoor positioning for location-based services (LBSs) has been an important research topic for the last decade. There are many other differences between indoor and outdoor MODBs. For examples, the area where the indoor moving objects are moving around is much smaller than where the outdoor moving objects are moving around, and the speed of indoor moving objects is much slower than that of outdoor ones. Therefore, the indoor moving object database (IMODB) should be studied separately from the outdoor MODB or the MODB. One of the most important problems that the MODB has to solve is the updating problem. In this regard, this paper proposes an updating method of IMODBs for location-based services. Our method applies the Kalman filter to the most recently collected series of measured positions to estimate the moving object's position and velocity at the last moment of the series of the measurements and extrapolates the current position with the estimated position and velocity. If the difference between the extrapolated current position and the measured current position is less than the threshold, that is, if the two positions are close, we skip updating the IMODB. When the IMODB requires information on the moving object's position at a certain moment T, it applies the Kalman filter to the series of the recorded measurements at the moments before T and extrapolates the position at T with the Kalman filter in the same manner as the updating process described earlier. To verify the efficiency of our updating method, we applied our method to a series of measured positions obtained by employing the fingerprinting indoor positioning method while we walked through the test bed. We then analyzed the test results to calculate savings of communication cost and error. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Image recognition techniques have been widely used in positioning systems in recent years. By recognizing the objects targeted by users' camera, one can decide the users' location. In this paper, a mobile indoor positioning system based on the image recognition techniques is implemented for shopping malls. We recognize the stores by their logos, and then use the location of the stores to locate the users. The image recognition method includes extracting local features from the image, calculating the Bag-of-Word structure through a pre-trained hierarchical clustering tree, and using cosine similarity to make the comparison between the training images and the query images. Though SIFT and SURF are the most extensively used local feature detectors and descriptors in the field, the limitations of mobile devices make them infeasible due to their high computational complexity. Moreover, both SIFT and SURF are patent-protected and are not free modules in OpenCV4Android, which will cause additional cost. Therefore, in this paper, we attempt to adopt features that exclude SIFT and SURF. By analyzing the precision and speed of pairwise mashup of feature detectors and descriptors, we target to find the most suitable pair of algorithms to be used on mobile devices.

A novel algorithm is proposed that uses only partial knowledge of the service area topology, particularly of the positions of objects which are capable of causing undetected direct path (UDP) propagation conditions. Although the spirit of the proposed approach, because of the lack of information on the range error statistics, is to remove measurements performed under UDP conditions from the computation of the location estimate, these measurements are used implicitly by the algorithm to contribute to the erroneous trial locations being discarded. A cooperative stage is included that allows the probability of localization of a target with an insufficient initial number of accurate range measurements to increase. The proposed algorithm outperforms a variety of alternative positioning techniques, and thus illustrates the capability of this topology knowledge to mitigate the UDP problem, even in the absence of any knowledge about the range error statistics. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract = {When rendering virtual objects in a mixed reality application, it is helpful to have access to an environment map that captures the appearance of the scene from the perspective of the virtual object. It is straightforward to render virtual objects into such maps, but capturing and correctly rendering the real components of the scene into the map is much more challenging. This information is often recovered from physical light probes, such as reflective spheres or fisheye cameras, placed at the location of the virtual object in the scene. For many application areas, however, real light probes would be intrusive or impractical. Ideally, all of the information necessary to produce detailed environment maps could be captured using a single device. We introduce a method using an RGBD camera and a small fisheye camera, contained in a single unit, to create environment maps at any location in an indoor scene. The method combines the output from both cameras to correct for their limited field of view and the displacement from the virtual object, producing complete environment maps suitable for rendering the virtual content in real time. Our method improves on previous probeless approaches by its ability to recover high-frequency environment maps. We demonstrate how this can be used to render virtual objects which shadow, reflect and refract their environment convincingly. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {The use of magnetic field variations for positioning and navigation has been suggested by several researchers. In most of the applications, the magnetic field is used to determine the azimuth or heading. However, for indoor applications, accurate heading determination is difficult due to the presence of magnetic field anomalies. Here location fingerprinting methodology can take advantage of these anomalies. In fact, the more significant the local anomalies, the more unique the magnetic 'fingerprint'. In general, the more elements in each fingerprint, the better for positioning. Unfortunately, magnetic field intensity data only consists of three components. Since true north (or magnetic north) is generally unknown, even with help of the accelerometer to detect the direction of the gravity, only two components can be extracted, i.e. The horizontal intensity and the vertical intensity (or total intensity and inclination). Furthermore, moving objects containing ferromagnetic materials and electronic devices may affect the magnetic field. Tests were carried out to investigate the feasibility of using magnetic field alone for indoor positioning. Possible solutions are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The genetic algorithm is used to synthesize the radiation pattern of the directional circular arc array to minimize the bit error rate (BER) performance in indoor wireless communication system. The impulse responses of the indoor channel for any transmitter-receiver location are computed by shooting and bouncing ray/image techniques. By using the impulse response of multipath channel, the performance of the synthesized antenna pattern on BPSK (binary phase shift keying) system with phase and timing recovery circuits can be calculated. Based on the topography of the antenna and the BER formula, the synthesis problem can be reformulated into an optimization problem and solved by the genetic algorithm. The novelty of our approach is choosing BER as the object function instead of sidelobe level of the antenna pattern, i.e., BER performance is defined as a object function to optimize the excitation coefficient of array by the genetic algorithm. The strong point of the genetic algorithm is that it can find out the solution even if the performance index cannot be formulated by simple equations. Besides, the genetic algorithm will converge to global extreme instead of local extreme and achieves a good antenna pattern. Numerical results show that the synthesized antenna pattern is effective to combat the multipath fading and can increase the transmission rate of indoor millimeter wave system. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {RFID is widely used for object tracking in indoor environments, e.g., airport baggage tracking. Analyzing RFID data offers insight into the underlying tracking systems as well as the associated business processes. However, the inherent uncertainty in RFID data, including noise (cross readings) and incompleteness (missing readings), pose challenges to high-level RFID data querying and analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a learning-based data cleansing approach that, unlike existing approaches, requires no detailed prior knowledge about the spatiotemporal properties of the indoor space and the RFID reader deployment. Requiring only minimal information about RFID deployment, the approach learns relevant knowledge from raw RFID data and uses it to cleanse the data. In particular, we model raw RFID readings as time series that are sparse because the indoor space is only partly covered by a limited number of RFID readers. We propose the Indoor RFID Multi-variate Hidden Markov Model (IR-MHMM) to capture the uncertainties of indoor RFID data as well as the correlation of moving object locations and object RFID readings. We propose three state space design methods for IR-MHMM that enable the learning of parameters while contending with raw RFID data time series. We solely use raw uncleansed RFID data for the learning of model parameters, requiring no special labeled data or ground truth. The resulting IR-MHMM based RFID data cleansing approach is able to recover missing readings and reduce cross readings with high effectiveness and efficiency, as demonstrated by extensive experimental studies with both synthetic and real data. Given enough indoor RFID data for learning, the proposed approach achieves a data cleansing accuracy comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art techniques requiring very detailed prior knowledge, making our solution superior in terms of both effectiveness and employability. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {As people spend significant parts of daily lives indoors, it is useful and important to measure indoor densities and find the dense regions in many indoor scenarios like space management and security control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that finds top-k indoor dense regions by using indoor positioning data. Such data is obtained by indoor positioning systems working at a relatively low frequency, and the reported locations in the data are discrete, from a preselected location set that does not continuously cover the entire indoor space. When a search is triggered, the object positioning information is already out-of-date and thus object locations are uncertain. To this end, we first integrate object location uncertainty into the definitions for counting objects in an indoor region and computing its density. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough analysis of the location uncertainty in the context of complex indoor topology, deriving upper and lower bounds of indoor region densities and introducing distance decaying effect into computing concrete indoor densities. Enabled by the uncertainty analysis outcomes, we design efficient search algorithms for solving the problem. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental studies on our proposals using synthetic and real data. The experimental results verify that the proposed search approach is efficient, scalable, and effective. The top-k indoor dense regions returned by our search are considerably consistent with ground truth, despite that the search uses neither historical data nor extra knowledge about objects. {\textcopyright} 1989-2012 IEEE.},

Plenty of research work focuses on location detection and activity recognition, with applications in the area of Ambient Assisted Living. The basis of this work is the idea that locations can be characterized by the presence of specific objects. Our objective is the recognition of locations in egocentric videos that mainly consist of indoor house scenes. We perform an extensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based classification methods that aim at finding the in-house location by classifying the detected objects which are extracted with a state-of-the-art object detector. We show that location classification is affected by the quality of the detected objects, i.e., the false detections among the correct ones in a series of frames, but this effect can be greatly limited by taking into account the temporal structure of the information by using LSTM. Finally, we argue about the potential for useful real-world applications. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {The availability of indoor positioning renders it possible to deploy location-based services in indoor spaces. Many such services will benefit from the efficient support for k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries over large populations of indoor moving objects. However, existing kNN techniques fall short in indoor spaces because these differ from Euclidean and spatial network spaces and because of the limited capabilities of indoor positioning technologies. To contend with indoor settings, we propose the new concept of minimal indoor walking distance (MIWD) along with algorithms and data structures for distance computing and storage; and we differentiate the states of indoor moving objects based on a positioning device deployment graph, utilize these states in effective object indexing structures, and capture the uncertainty of object locations. On these foundations, we study the probabilistic threshold kNN (PTkNN) query. Given a query location q and a probability threshold T, this query returns all subsets of k objects that have probability larger than T of containing the kNN query result of q. We propose a combination of three techniques for processing this query. The first uses the MIWD metric to prune objects that are too far away. The second uses fast probability estimates to prune unqualified objects and candidate result subsets. The third uses efficient probability evaluation for computing the final result on the remaining candidate subsets. An empirical study using both synthetic and real data shows that the techniques are efficient. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

In this paper, we propose a method comprising of three characteristics to characterise indoor positioning estimation. We conducted experiments on an active radio frequency identification (RFID)-based real-time location system in different environmental conditions. We used both a human and a robot to traverse two experimental areas and collected positioning results at different fixed points along the traversal path. Using this basic positioning data, we were able to characterise positioning estimation using three characterisations: position accuracy, centroid consistency and angular distribution. We demonstrate the use of these characteristics for examining different points in a travelling path and different measurements. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

To overcome the difficulties due to illumination change, several types of image features are used in a collaborative fashion, for which brightness intensity, hue, local binary pattern (LBP) and depth from 3D camera are considered. In addition, our method also exploits multiple camera views to resolve the occlusion between objects. Our algorithm first implements the background subtraction to extract moving objects from each camera view and then executes the human identification process to determine whether the human is previously confirmed. The proposed algorithm estimates the vertical axes of the humans detected in multiple calibrated camera views, which leads to generating the cross points of the detected human objects. Finally, the cross points (the location of the human objects) are fed into adaptive particle filter based on spatio-temporal information to track the human objects. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined through experiments performed in varying indoor illumination and occlusion conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Employing different sensor capabilities, 3D features are detected autonomously very quickly. The main contribution of the paper is to let the robot move to a new unexplored place, based on some prospect values of this place. One of these prospect values is the natural feature quality available at that place, whereas the second prospect value is the navigation cost to it. The vision-based feature extractor is demonstrated, showing how it is self motivated to search for an interesting region using a segmentation and detection process. The obtained region is classified into known objects, and the relative location information for the selected object is memorized. The mobile robot plans its motion such that it continuously builds up a geometrical model of the features, taking into consideration the cost of reaching a target point. The target point is chosen depending on the number of the features and their visibility that a robot can cover with its sensors upon reaching that location. The captured information from these sensors is transformed into different representations in order to achieve the task. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {The surveying technique of photogrammetry has been proven to be safe, efficient, and inexpensive to extracting spatial data (i.e. shape, size, position) of infrastructure from collected photos. These data are useful in many infrastructure and construction applications such as quality control and quantity take-off. However, photogrammetry has not been widely used in construction projects because much effort is still needed to convert the image data into a three-dimensional (3D) geometric model in the physical space. More specifically, it demands manually marking object vertices and edges and referencing them across photos. To alleviate this situation, this paper proposes a novel method to group and link line segments in order to automate the object vertices and edges marking process. In the proposed method, small, discontinuous line segments are first detected in an image, and classified into different sets based on the vanishing points they belong to. Within each set, a novel algorithm is created to link the line segments into long line segments. Next, the corner information is derived from the image by a classic corner detector, and utilized to assure the actual locations of endpoints of each obtained long line segment. By removing the remaining ungrouped or unlinked small line segments, the final result is a set of complete and accurate line edges readily to be used in the ensuing step of photogrammetric process. So far, the grouping and classification of line segments have been implemented. The test result from outdoor and indoor images indicates effectiveness and promise of the method in facilitating the automation and broad applications of photogrammetry in construction. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and development of autonomous attitude stabilization, navigation in unstructured, GPS-denied environments, aggressive landing on inclined surfaces, and aerial gripping using onboard sensors on a low-cost, custom-built quadrotor. The development of a multi-functional micro air vehicle (MAV) that utilizes inexpensive off-the-shelf components presents multiple challenges due to noise and sensor accuracy, and there are control challenges involved with achieving various capabilities beyond navigation. This paper addresses these issues by developing a complete system from the ground up, addressing the attitude stabilization problem using extensive filtering and an attitude estimation filter recently developed in the literature. Navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments is achieved using a visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm that relies on an onboard monocular camera. The system utilizes nested controllers for attitude stabilization, vision-based navigation, and guidance, with the navigation controller implemented using a nonlinear controller based on the sigmoid function. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by maintaining a stable hover even in the presence of wind gusts and when manually hitting and pulling on the quadrotor. Precision landing on inclined surfaces is demonstrated as an example of an aggressive maneuver, and is performed using only onboard sensing. Aerial gripping is accomplished with the addition of a secondary camera, capable of detecting infrared light sources, which is used to estimate the 3D location of an object, while an under-actuated and passively compliant manipulator is designed for effective gripping under uncertainty. The quadrotor is therefore able to autonomously navigate inside and outside, in the presence of disturbances, and perform tasks such as aggressively landing on inclined surfaces and locating and grasping an object, using only inexpensive, onboard sensors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {(Figure Presented). We present a novel solution to automatic semantic modeling of indoor scenes from a sparse set of low-quality RGB-D images. Such data presents challenges due to noise, low resolution, occlusion and missing depth information. We exploit the knowledge in a scene database containing 100s of indoor scenes with over 10,000 manually segmented and labeled mesh models of objects. In seconds, we output a visually plausible 3D scene, adapting these models and their parts to fit the input scans. Contextual relationships learned from the database are used to constrain reconstruction, ensuring semantic compatibility between both object models and parts. Small objects and objects with incomplete depth information which are difficult to recover reliably are processed with a two-stage approach. Major objects are recognized first, providing a known scene structure. 2D contour-based model retrieval is then used to recover smaller objects. Evaluations using our own data and two public datasets show that our approach can model typical real-world indoor scenes efficiently and robustly. Copyright {\textcopyright} ACM.},

abstract = {People detection and tracking is a key issue for social robot design and effective human robot interaction. This paper addresses the problem of detecting people with a mobile robot using a stereo camera. People detection using mobile robots is a difficult task because in real world scenarios it is common to find: unpredictable motion of people, dynamic environments, and different degrees of human body occlusion. Additionally, we cannot expect people to cooperate with the robot to perform its task. In our people detection method, first, an object segmentation method that uses the distance information provided by a stereo camera is used to separate people from the background. The segmentation method proposed in this work takes into account human body proportions to segment people and provides a first estimation of people location. After segmentation, an adaptive contour people model based on people distance to the robot is used to calculate a probability of detecting people. Finally, people are detected merging the probabilities of the contour people model and by evaluating evidence over time by applying a Bayesian scheme. We present experiments on detection of standing and sitting people, as well as people in frontal and side view with a mobile robot in real world scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Acoustic event Detection (AED) is concerned with recognition of sound which is produced by the human and the object that is handled by human or by nature. The Detection of acoustic events is an important task for our intelligent system which is supposed to recognize not only speech but also sounds of our indoor and outdoor environments that includes information retrieval, audio-based surveillance and monitoring systems. Currently, System for detection and classification of events from our daily monophonic sound is mature enough to extract features and detect isolated events nearly accurate but accuracy is very low for large dataset and for noisy and overlapped audio events. Mostly the real life sounds are polyphonic and events have some part of overlap which is harder to detect. In our work we will discuss the previous issues for detection and feature extraction of acoustic events. We use the DCASE dataset, published in an international IEEE AASP challenge for Acoustic Event Detection which includes the "office live" recordings which were prepared in an office environment. MFCC is a technique commonly used for features extraction of speech and Acoustic event. We propose to use the Gabor filterbank in addition to MFCCs coefficients to analyze the feature. For Classification we use the Decision tree algorithm that gives better classification and detection result. . Finally, we compare our proposed system with each system that was used for DCASE dataset and concluded that our technique gives best F-Score value in detection of events as compare to others. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a holistic classification scheme for different room types, like office or meeting room, based on 3D features. Such a categorization of scenes provides a rich source of information about potential objects, object locations, and activities typically found in them. Scene categorization is a challenging task. While outdoor scenes can be sufficiently characterized by color and texture features, indoor scenes consist of human-made structures that vary in terms of color and texture across different individual rooms of the same category. Nevertheless, humans tend to have an immediate impression in which room type they are. We suggest that such a decision could be based on the coarse spatial layout of a scene. Therefore, we present a system that categorizes different room types based on 3D sensor data extracted by a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. We extract planar structures combining region growing and RANSAC approaches. Then, feature vectors are defined on statistics over the relative sizes of the planar patches, the angles between pairs of (close) patches, and the ratios between sizes of pairs of patches to train classifiers. Experiments in a mobile robot scenario study the performance in classifying a room based on a single percept. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Localization of objects is fast becoming a major aspect of wireless technologies, with applications in logistics, surveillance, and emergency response. Time-of-arrival (TOA) localization is ideally suited for high-precision localization of objects in particular in indoor environments, where GPS is not available. This paper considers the case where one transmitter and multiple, distributed, receivers are used to estimate the location of a passive (reflecting) object. It furthermore focuses on the situation when the transmitter and receivers can be synchronized, so that TOA (as opposed to time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)) information can be used. We propose a novel, Two-Step estimation (TSE) algorithm for the localization of the object. We then derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for TOA and show that it is an order of magnitude lower than the CRLB of TDOA in typical setups. The TSE algorithm achieves the CRLB when the TOA measurements are subject to small Gaussian-distributed errors, which is verified by analytical and simulation results. Moreover, practical measurement results show that the estimation error variance of TSE can be 33 dB lower than that of TDOA based algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

In certain scenarios, however, attaching tags to objects may be impractical due to cost and protection issues. In this paper, we propose TagFree, a novel object differentiation scheme without attaching tags. Instead of relying on external tags, we exploit the inherent radiometric properties of different objects as their signatures. To improve the robustness and efficiency of TagFree, we empirically determine a spatial safe zone and harness successive cancellation to distinguish multiple objects simultaneously. We prototype TagFree on commercial WiFi infrastructure and evaluate its performance in various indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that TagFree achieves single object distinguishing accuracy of 96{\%} measured at the same location, and over 80{\%} within the safe zone range of up to 3m along a 7m link. TagFree can also differentiate up to 3 objects with acceptable accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

Most of the existing approaches are based on sensors which allow to accurately determine the locations of people but do not provide means to distinguish between different persons. In this paper we propose a novel approach to tracking moving objects and their identity using noisy, sparse information collected by id-sensors such as infrared and ultrasound badge systems. The key idea of our approach is to use particle filters to estimate the locations of people on the Voronoi graph of the environment. By restricting particles to a graph, we make use of the inherent structure of indoor environments. The approach has two key advantages. First, it is by far more efficient and robust than unconstrained particle filters. Second, the Voronoi graph provides a natural discretization of human motion, which allows us to apply unsupervised learning techniques to derive typical motion patterns of the people in the environment. Experiments using a robot to collect ground-truth data indicate the superior performance of Voronoi tracking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EM-based learning of behavior patterns increases the tracking performance and provides valuable information for high-level behavior recognition.},

abstract = {Localization of persons and objects has become a necessity in many industrial services. In indoor circumstances, radio frequency identification (RFID) has superior performance. However, radio signals within indoor environments are generally weak, and the tags have very restricted abilities. In addition, the multipath propagation, total cost, and signal interference increase with increasing number of reference tags over a certain limit. Therefore, to improve the performance of indoor positioning for real-time localization, a new active acquisition method for an active RFID system that works at 2.4 GHz has been proposed; it is called the boundary virtual reference (BVIRE) algorithm. It depends on boundary virtual reference tags rather than increasing the number of real reference tags, which in turn reduces the total cost while maintaining the location accuracy. We have implemented a linear regression method to further enhance the positioning accuracy while eliminating the unnecessary tags from the estimation method using event filtering, in which only a few neighbouring reference tags are helpful in deciding the location of the object tag. The experimental results show that our BVIRE algorithm considerably reduces the error estimation compared with previous algorithms. The system has enhanced the positioning accuracy and lowered the total costs. In addition, the localization precision of the proposed approach has been significantly increased to approximately 90.25 {\%} compared with PinPoint algorithm with no additional reference tags or radio frequency interference; this represents a significant improvement over other algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Currently, in the ROK, IoT holds the limelight and various types of IoT equipments that integrate the "Smart function" to existing electric or electronic equipments are being developed and introduced to the market. It takes many hours and much efforts to attach the smart equipments to each existing equipment to realize a complete IoT system so that this study is to make the central control device to recognize each product, provide relevant information to the product and command it to perform the movements corresponding the command, without additional smart equipments. Since interior structural changes of a household or a building are rare, relevant information can be provided to the user by tracking which object or structure he/she is being positioned in front of. However, the existing commercial positioning systems such as GPS and others often do not offer high-precision level and cannot be used indoors. The proposed system in this article attempts to localize the user's position by triangulation based on the signals emitted from widely installed beacons acting as the reference points. This concept does not use GPS satellite(s) but employ its basic principle. The system adopts the BLE and its exclusive equipments which allow a long-term operation of a beacon from approx. 1.8 to 28.7 months with the CR2045 battery due to their low power consumption rates. Thus, a location-based application service based on the BLE-utilized positioning system has been proposed in this study. In the design, smart phone's geomagnetic sensor and the acceleration sensor have been integrated within the BLE-based ranging system. The distance and direction of a beacon from one's own position will be indicated on the GUI map based on the measurements. In addition, a database for the initial values will be established so that there's no need to set up the initial value beforehand. The position of the relevant object can be estimated by aggregating the realtime measurements in the way of PIC control. This way, a rough estimation can be performed even with just one beacon. {\textcopyright} 2017 ACM.},

abstract = {Identifying objects based on language descriptions is an important capability for robots interacting with people in everyday environments. People naturally use attributes and names to refer to objects of interest. Due to the complexity of indoor environments and the fact that people use various ways to refer to objects, a robot frequently encounters new objects or object names. To deal with such situations, a robot must be able to continuously grow its object knowledge base. In this work we introduce a system that organizes objects and names in a semantic hierarchy. Similarity between name words is learned via a hierarchy embedded vector representation. The hierarchy enables reasoning about unknown objects and names. Novel objects are inserted automatically into the knowledge base, where the exact location in the hierarchy is determined by asking a user questions. The questions are informed by the current hierarchy and the appearance of the object. Experiments demonstrate that the learned representation captures the meaning of names and is helpful for object identification with new names. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Handheld devices like smartphones and tablets have emerged as one of the most promising platforms for Augmented Reality (AR). The increased usage of these portable handheld devices has enabled handheld AR applications to reach the end-users; hence, it is timely and important to seriously consider the user experience of such applications. AR visualizations for occluded objects enable an observer to look through objects. AR visualizations have been predominantly evaluated using Head-Worn Displays (HWDs), handheld devices have rarely been used. However, unless we gain a better understanding of the perceptual and cognitive effects of handheld AR systems, effective interfaces for handheld devices cannot be designed. Similarly, human perception of AR systems in outdoor environments, which provide a higher degree of variation than indoor environments, has only been insufficiently explored. In this paper, we present insights acquired from five experiments we performed using handheld devices in outdoor locations. We provide design recommendations for handheld AR systems equipped with visualizations for occluded objects. Our key conclusions are the following: (1) Use of visualizations for occluded objects improves the depth perception of occluded objects akin to non-occluded objects. (2) To support different scenarios, handheld AR systems should provide multiple visualizations for occluded objects to complement each other. (3) Visual clutter in AR visualizations reduces the visibility of occluded objects and deteriorates depth judgment; depth judgment can be improved by providing clear visibility of the occluded objects. (4) Similar to virtual reality interfaces, both egocentric and exocentric distances are underestimated in handheld AR. (5) Depth perception will improve if handheld AR systems can dynamically adapt their geometric field of view (GFOV) to match the display field of view (DFOV). (6) Large handheld displays are hard to carry and use; however, they enable users to better grasp the depth of multiple graphical objects that are presented simultaneously. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Registration is one of the most difficult problems in augmented reality (AR) systems. In this paper, a simple registration method using natural features based on the projective reconstruction technique is proposed. This method consists of two steps: embedding and rendering. Embedding involves specifying four points to build the world coordinate system on which a virtual object will be superimposed. In rendering, the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker is used to track the natural feature correspondences in the live video. The natural features that have been tracked are used to estimate the corresponding projective matrix in the image sequence. Next, the projective reconstruction technique is used to transfer the four specified points to compute the registration matrix for augmentation. This paper also proposes a robust method for estimating the projective matrix, where the natural features that have been tracked are normalized (translation and scaling) and used as the input data. The estimated projective matrix will be used as an initial estimate for a nonlinear optimization method that minimizes the actual residual errors based on the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) minimization method, thus making the results more robust and stable. The proposed registration method has three major advantages: 1) It is simple, as no predefined fiducials or markers are used for registration for either indoor and outdoor AR applications. 2) It is robust, because it remains effective as long as at least six natural features are tracked during the entire augmentation, and the existence of the corresponding projective matrices in the live video is guaranteed. Meanwhile, the robust method to estimate the projective matrix can obtain stable results even when there are some outliers during the tracking process. 3) Virtual objects can still be superimposed on the specified areas, even if some parts of the areas are occluded during the entire process. Some indoor and outdoor experiments have been conducted to validate the performance of this proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Robots often have to deal with the challenges of operating in dynamic and sometimes unpredictable environments. Although an occupancy map of the environment is sufficient for navigation of a mobile robot or manipulation tasks with a robotic arm in static environments, robots operating in dynamic environments demand richer information to improve robustness, efficiency, and safety. For instance, in path planning, it is important to know the direction of motion of dynamic objects at various locations of the environment for safer navigation or human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce directional statistics into robotic mapping to model circular data. Primarily, in collateral to occupancy grid maps, we propose directional grid maps to represent the location-wide long-term angular motion of the environment. Being highly representative, this defines a probability measure-field over the longitude-latitude space rather than a scalar-field or a vector-field. Withal, we further demonstrate how the same theory can be used to model angular variations in the spatial domain, temporal domain, and spatiotemporal domain. We carried out a series of experiments to validate the proposed models using a variety of robots having different sensors such as RGB cameras and LiDARs on simulated and real-world settings in both indoor and outdoor environments. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

Recent oor plan construction work crowdsources mobile sensing data from smartphone users for scalability. However, they incur long time (e.g., weeks or months) and tremendous efforts in data collection, and many rely on images thus suffering technical and privacy limitations. In this paper, we propose BatMapper, which explores a previously untapped sensing modality - acoustics - for fast, fine grained and low cost oor plan construction. We design sound signals suitable for heterogeneous microphones on commodity smartphones, and acoustic signal processing techniques to produce accurate distance measurements to nearby objects. We further develop robust probabilistic echo-object association, recursive outlier removal and probabilistic resampling algorithms to identify the correspondence between distances and objects, thus the geometry of corridors and rooms. We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Experiments in real buildings show BatMapper achieves 1-2cm distance accuracy in ranges up around 4m; a 2 ∼ 3 minute walk generates fine grained corridor shapes, detects doors at 92{\%} precision and 1 ∼ 2m location error at 90-percentile; and tens of seconds of measurement gestures produce room geometry with errors {\textless} 0:3m at 80-percentile, at 1-2 orders of magnitude less data amounts and user efforts. {\textcopyright} 2017 ACM.},

At present, the indoor positioning is mainly based on wireless signals, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth etc. The cost and power consumption of using WiFi, RFID and Zigbee to realize the indoor positioning is very high and the deployment of WiFi, RFID and Zigbee is inconvenient. In this paper,indoor positioning is based on Bluetooth ibeacon, which is Bluetooth 4.0 standard. The power consumption and the cost of Bluetooth 4.0 is lower than others. In addition, Bluetooth has spread widely in the distance. This paper proposes a new indoor location method, which uses the method of learning to train the Bluetooth signal propagation model in the museum environment and uses the method of weighted least square and four-border positioning to estimate the location of the target object. The experimental result shows that the method is stable and good robustness. The positioning accuracy meets the requirements of the indoor positioning. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Automation of modern industrial plants require real-time tracking of object locations and sensing of local and ambient parameters for variety of applications such as counting and tracking of objects in assembly line, detection and positioning of failures of machines etc. Mostly, discrete Real Time Location System (RTLS) performs object tracking in existing industrial automation without its integration with the sensing and control network, which constrains application's responsiveness. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution of Wireless Positioning Sensor Network (WPSN) that is designed for accuracy, reliability, scalability and optimal network operation. The proposed WPSN is applicable for harsh indoor industrial environments for not only monitoring and control of plant operations but also for identification, localization and tracking of assets and inventory in industrial warehouses. The indoor industrial environment poses challenging conditions for radio signal propagation that adversely affects reliability of communication of sensing and location data. We approach reliability by incorporating redundancy and making our network reconfigurable through adaptive intelligent learning process. We employ adaptive clustering technique to address the need of scalable deployment for varied industrial scenarios. We include hybrid localization scheme to provide high precision positioning but with fallback reduced precision operation to deal with long-term channel impairment. The WPSN is connected with backend cloud infrastructure for low cost monitoring and control. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

To these robots, it is important to perform environmental cognition not only building environment map for autonomous motion of the robots but also estimating presences of human around the robots. In this study, by utilizing human state estimation function and SLAM based mapping technology, a concept and architecture of Human Motion Map by representing human behavior in the human living space as a hybrid map system are proposed. Beyond the conventional map which represents the existence of wall and objects, Human Motion Map represents not only the existence of humans in a particular location but also motion distributions. With recent improvements of the cloud computing technology, Human Motion Map can be accumulated as a kind of big data while measurements of robots are performed continuingly while it is moving around. In this paper, we propose a motion feature classification algorithm for clustering human motions geographically.

Indoor tracking data can be enormous and are not immediately ready for finding dense locations. This paper presents two graph-based models for constrained and semi-constrained indoor movement, respectively, and then uses the models to map raw tracking records into mapping records that represent object entry and exit times in particular locations. Subsequently, an efficient indexing structure called Hierarchical Dense Location Time Index (HDLT-Index) is proposed for indexing the time intervals of the mapping table, along with index construction, query processing, and pruning techniques. The HDLT-Index supports very efficient aggregate point, interval, and duration queries as well as dense location queries.

Mobile infrastructure consists of one or more sensors in a fixed configuration on a mobile platform, and a set of tags affixed to objects or locations in the environment which the users want to localize. It is especially useful in cases where infrastructure is needed only temporarily, such as during installation, calibration, or maintenance. Mobile infrastructure can cover a much larger area than installed infrastructure with the same number of sensors, and is especially useful in cases where localization hardware costs are asymmetric, with expensive sensors and inexpensive tags. The data collected at various positions are combined by a simple "leapfrog" procedure, with constrained optimization to obtain better accuracy.

The scene is represented by a 3D volume. Every object in the scene is associated with a distinctive label to represent its existence at every voxel location. The label links together automatically-learned view-specific appearance models of the respective object, so as to avoid the photometric calibration of the cameras. Generative probabilistic sensor models can be derived by analyzing the dependencies between the sensor observations and object labels. Bayesian reasoning is then applied to achieve robust reconstruction against real-world environment challenges, such as lighting variations, changing background etc. Our main contribution is to explicitly model the visual occlusion process and show: (1) static objects (such as trees or lamp posts), as parts of the pre-learned background model, can be automatically recovered as a byproduct of the inference; (2) ambiguities due to inter-occlusion between multiple dynamic objects can be alleviated, and the final reconstruction quality is drastically improved.

The existing methods typically consider the semantic mapping as the final goal and differ in the number and types of considered semantic categories. We envision semantic understanding of the environment as an on-going process and seek representations which can be refined and adapted depending on the task and robot's interaction with the environment. In this work we propose a novel and efficient method for semantic parsing, which can be adapted to the task at hand and enables localization of objects of interest in indoor environments. For basic mobility tasks we demonstrate how to obtain initial semantic segmentation of the scene into ground, structure, furniture and props categories which constitute the first level of hierarchy. Then, we propose a simple and efficient method for predicting locations of objects that based on their size afford a manipulation task. In our experiments we use the publicly available NYU V2 dataset and obtain better or comparable results than the state of the art at a fraction of the computational cost.

Using the coarse map, the system autonomously plans consecutive observations at the intersections of lines connecting object points, where the directions of the imaging are estimated easily and precisely. From two panoramic views at the two planned locations, a modified binocular stereo method yields a more precise, but with direction-dependent uncertainties, local map.

One approach to reducing acquisition time is to acquire laser range data through a dynamically small subset of measurement locations. The reconstruction can then be performed based on the concept of compressed sensing (CS), where a sparse signal representation allows for signal reconstruction at sub-Nyquist measurements. Motivated by this, a novel multi-scale saliency-guided CS-based algorithm is proposed for an efficient robotic laser range data acquisition for robotic vision. The proposed system samples the objects of interest through an optimized probability density function derived based on multi-scale saliency rather than the uniform random distribution used in traditional CS systems. Experimental results with laser range data from indoor and outdoor environments show that the proposed approach requires less than half the samples needed by existing CS-based approaches while maintaining the same reconstruction performance. In addition, the proposed method offers significant improvement in reconstruction SNR compared to current CS-based approaches. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The framework produces a 3D room model in situ with five selections from user without prior knowledge on actual geometry distance or additional apparatus. Using the framework, non-experts can easily capture room dimensions and annotate locations and objects within the room for linking virtual information to the real space represented by an approximated box. For registering 3D room model to the real space, an hybrid method of visual tracking and device sensors obtains accurate orientation tracking result and still achieves interactive frame-rates for real-time applications on a mobile phone. Once the created room model is registered to the real space, user-generated annotations can be attached and viewed in AR and VR modes. Finally, the framework supports object-based space to space registration for viewing and creating annotations from different views other than the view that generated the annotations. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated with achieved model accuracy, modeling time, stability of visual tracking and satisfaction of annotation.

At the same time, the system scans RFID tags nearby and captures images for scanned RFID-Tagged objects. This information is accumulated in a database and is accessible for future item location activities. Since all information was gathered during users' searching activities, the proposed system does not require users' effort for managing and registering tags. We asked 10 users to compare our method with the conventional method, which shows RSSI of the target item, of searching for the target item. The results suggest that our method is effective for location target RFID-Tagged items. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {Thanks to the development of wireless communication and sensor technology, a smart object that is embedded sensors and/or communication equipment in objects that we use in daily lives is researched. Also the Internet of Things (IoT) is a networking technology by using the smart objects and attracts high attention. Furthermore, a smart home which consists of these technologies is expected to be spread widely. In the smart home, it is important to get the information of location/position accurately in order to provide services based on the information of person or object. One of the most popular methods for estimating the position of person or object, the Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) method is used for many systems. RSSI method uses a behavior that strength of a signal from beacon node is inversely proportional to distance. However, the location of the wireless nodes which receive a signal has to fix and be discovered in advance. Therefore if the nodes are moved from an original position, the person or object cannot be detected accurately. Accordingly, we propose a method that estimating the positions of moved nodes and updating the position information by adding node for the RSSI positioning method. Currently, we have performed preliminary implementation of the system. In the future we will finish the implementation of the methods designed in the paper and evaluate the methods in details. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

These emerging scenarios are expected to be composed by a potentially huge amount of heterogeneous smart objects which can be remotely accessed by users via their mobile devices anytime, anywhere. In this paper, we propose a distributed location-aware access control mechanism and its application in the smart building context. Our approach is based on an access control engine embedded into smart objects, which are responsible to make authorization decisions by considering both user location data and access credentials. User location data are estimated using a novel indoor localization system based on magnetic field data sent by user through her personal phone. This localization system implements a combination of soft computing techniques over the data collected by smartphones. Therefore, our location-aware access control mechanism does not require any intermediate entity, providing the benefits of a decentralized approach for smart environments. From the results obtained, we can consider our proposal as a promising approach to tackle the challenging security requirements of typical pervasive environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The doors and ceiling lamps have been chosen to be detected in the initial phase of our system. The scene was divided into four different regions. The edges resulting from the walls/ceiling and the walls/floor intersections are the boundaries that separate the different regions. The use of the log-polar mapping transforms the problem of finding four edges of unknown orientations, that separated the different regions, into finding four horizontal edges. The log-polar map was performed such that it possesses the varying resolution property. The objects were detected using model-matching in the log-polar domain. The varying resolution property of the mapping simplified the model-matching problem. The detection (of edges and then objects) was very fast due to the small size of the log-polar image (64×64) pixels.},

Next trajectory information for each object is generated using multi-frame graph matching. Finally, multiple features including size and location are used to generate an object score. At frame-level, we consider total activity, event score, number of objects and cumulative object score. These features are used to generate score information using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The algorithm. The best view is selected using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), which utilizes camera network information. DBN employs previous view information to select the current view thus increasing resilience to frequent switching. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on three multi-camera setups with semi-overlapping fields of view: a basketball game, an indoor airport surveillance scenario and a synthetic outdoor pedestrian dataset. We compare the proposed view selection approach with a maximum score based camera selection criterion and demonstrate a significant decrease in camera flickering. The performance of the proposed approach is also validated through subjective testing. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Spatial relationships between objects provide important information for text-based image retrieval. As users are more likely to describe a scene from a real world perspective, using 3D spatial relationships rather than 2D relationships that assume a particular viewing direction, one of the main challenges is to infer the 3D structure that bridges images with users' text descriptions. However, direct inference of 3D structure from images requires learning from large scale annotated data. Since interactions between objects can be reduced to a limited set of atomic spatial relations in 3D, we study the possibility of inferring 3D structure from a text description rather than an image, applying physical relation models to synthesize holistic 3D abstract object layouts satisfying the spatial constraints present in a textual description. We present a generic framework for retrieving images from a textual description of a scene by matching images with these generated abstract object layouts. Images are ranked by matching object detection outputs (bounding boxes) to 2D layout candidates (also represented by bounding boxes) which are obtained by projecting the 3D scenes with sampled camera directions. We validate our approach using public indoor scene datasets and show that our method outperforms baselines built upon object occurrence histograms and learned 2D pairwise relations. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

@article{Papapostolou2012861,
abstract = {Location awareness in an indoor environment and wireless access to Internet applications are major research areas towards the overwhelming success of wireless and mobile communications. However, the unpredictable indoor radio propagation and handover latency due to node mobility are the main challenging issues that need to be addressed. For tackling efficiently both problems of indoor localization and handover management, we propose combining key benefits of two outstanding wireless technologies, i.e. radio frequency identification (RFID) and a wireless local area network (WLAN) infrastructure. WLANs, such as IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), are now very common in many indoor environments for providing wireless communication among WiFi-enabled devices by accessing an Access Point (infrastructure mode) or through peer to peer connections (ad hoc mode). However, the small cell size of the Access Points (APs) in a WiFi-based network drives the need for frequent handovers leading to increased latency. RFID is an emerging technology consisting of two basic components, a tag and a reader, and its main purpose is the automatic identification of tagged objects by a reader. However, in the presence of multiple readers, RFID suffers from the so-called reader collision problem, mainly due to the inability for direct communication among them. In this paper, we propose a hybrid RFID and WLAN system; the RFID technology is employed for collecting information that is used for both localization and handover management within the WLAN, whereas the WLAN itself is utilized for controlling and coordinating the RFID reading process. In our system architecture, tag IDs of a RFID tag deployment are correlated with both location and topology information in order to determine the position and predict the next subnetwork of a Mobile Node (MN) with a reader attached to its mobile device. The role of the WLAN is to coordinate the readers when accessing the RFID channel for retrieving tags' IDs, hence compensating the persisting RFID collision problem among multiple readers. Numerical results based on extensive simulations validate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid system in providing accurate and time efficient localization and reducing the IP handover latency. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract = {Location awareness is a key issue to improve the development of autonomous entities that are embedded into ubiquitous computing environments. GPS seems to be the best solution to develop outdoor location systems, but the performance of these systems is not good enough to locate objects or humans within indoor environments, mainly if accuracy and precision are required. In this article we propose the use of a cheap and reliable technology as RFID to develop a passive RFID-based indoor location system that is able to accurately locate autonomous entities, such as robots and people, within a defined surface. This system is applied to solve the robot tracking problem. We include the evaluation of the proposal by comparing our system technology performance with other alternatives built on different technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IrDA, ultrasound, etc.). We have also performed a location awareness proof concept test to analyze the viability of the approach. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor in predicting user's location in an indoor environment is evaluated. As resistance in indoor environment such as walls and movement of objects adversely affect the performance of the algorithm, emphasis is placed on RSS sample vector fluctuation correction. Two simulations were carried out, one adapting the fluctuation correction algorithm and one without fluctuation correction algorithm. The results of the investigation shows that deployment of fluctuation correction algorithm improves the prediction accuracy.

abstract = {In recent years the research on positioning and navigation systems for indoor environments has progressed rapidly. For this purpose many technologies based on e.g. UWB, WLAN, ultrasonic or infrared were utilized. However, these systems are restricted on line-of-sight (LOS) conditions due to disturbances, fading and multipath inside of buildings. Because magnetic fields are able to penetrate walls, building materials or other objects, a DC Magnetic signal based Indoor Local Positioning System (MILPS) was developed, which provides localisation in harsh indoor environments. Multiple electrical coils - representing reference stations - and tri-axial magnetometers as mobile stations are utilized. Capturing the magnetic field intensities of at least three different coils leads to the specific slope distances and finally to the observer's position. Because the current positioning algorithm is designed for stop-and-go applications originally, this contribution focuses on the sensor fusion of MILPS and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to face kinematic applications for wheeled platforms. The short time stable IMU-integrated data, which is influenced by sensor drifts and integration errors, is then supported by MILPS, which delivers positions in a low frequent update interval. To estimate a position in two dimensional environments - in the first step - an Iterative Kaiman Filter (IKF) is applied to eliminate linearization errors caused by inaccurate predictions. Therefore the dead reckoning trajectory is updated by using MILPS' distance observations. In this context first promising experiments with combinations of IMU and MILPS have been performed proving the capability of sensor integration. While acceleration and angular rate measurements lead to a state prediction (consisting of current position and velocity) external MILPS-observations are used for IMU-data support. The IKF estimates a current state in respect to both measurement systems' statistical information.},

We apply a Q-CNN model whose policy is to combine the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Q functions. The raw images are used as inputs and outputs action directly. To achieve the task, we develop a simulation environment in Gazebo, which provides indoor 3D scenes with physics engine and high-quality pictures. In the environment, agent can be controlled conveniently and interacted with objects freely. Our experiment is to find the shortest trajectories from the initial location to the target. After iterative training, we have trained a set of parameters to approximate Q function well and made it have a better performance.},

In order to reduce the influence of indoor environmental factors on the indoor wireless positioning, improve the positioning accuracy and expand the location area, the indoor wireless positioning method based on WiFi K-means is proposed. The improved distance formula is used to take into account the effect of attribute values, and the difference between different objects can be calculated more accurately. The AP in the position of each room is established by testing the signal strength of different signals.

In this study, a novel approach that uses VLC infrastructure and a photodetector is proposed to build a sparse map of an indoor area. VLC channel state information, which consists of the optical received signal strength and channel impulse response, is measured for wall/obstacle location estimation. The proposed algorithm uses the time-of-flight of the light to estimate the distance to the walls. The estimated wall locations are used as landmarks to build a sparse map of the indoor area. This technique can be used to estimate the distance to walls and objects in robotics applications. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be used to locate the agent and unknown LED locations using a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm. Root mean square error of our wall localization algorithm is less than 10 cm when the VLC channel signal-to-noise ratio is 80 dB.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen an increase in the attention towards indoor space and its applications. Within this research topic, landmarks play an important role as these distinct objects exert important functions in the context of navigation and in the construction of a cognitive model of an environment. However, compared to outdoor research, little research has been conducted related to indoor landmarks and their specific characteristics with respect to their use and description. Therefore, the presented study aims to investigate when or where landmarks are mostly needed during a navigational task in a building and how they are verbally expressed. In order to examine these aspects, eleven test persons completed a route in a complex building. While navigating, they had to think out loud and their verbal descriptions were analyzed and compared. The results of this study show that landmarks were most needed on locations where a change of orientation took place. In addition, most referrals were made to objects near the observer. Furthermore, participants preferred to use common nouns to refer to a landmark and more detailing was given by specifying color and material. Finally, the results indicate that predominantly the same elements form the basis to identify an indoor landmark as an outdoor landmark namely visual, structural and semantic features.},

abstract = {Map retrieval, the problem of similarity search over a large collection of 3D pointset maps previously built by mobile robots, is crucial for autonomous navigation in indoor and outdoor environments. Bag-of-words (BoW) methods constitute a popular approach to map retrieval; however, these methods have extremely limited descriptive ability because they ignore the spatial layout information of the local features. The main contribution of this paper is an extension of the bag-of-words map retrieval method to enable the use of spatial information from local features. Our strategy is to explicitly model a unique viewpoint of an input local map; the pose of the local feature is defined with respect to this unique viewpoint, and can be viewed as an additional invariant feature for discriminative map retrieval. Specifically, we wish to determine a unique viewpoint that is invariant to moving objects, clutter, occlusions, and actual viewpoints. Hence, we perform scene parsing to analyze the scene structure, and consider the "center" of the scene structure to be the unique viewpoint. Our scene parsing is based on a Manhattan world assumption that imposes a quasi-Manhattan world constraint to enable the robust detection of a scene structure that is invariant to clutter and moving objects. Experimental results using the publicly available University of Michigan North Campus Long-Term Vision and LIDAR Dataset (NCLT dataset [1]) validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

Information technology needed by the public that is looking for information position and location of destination in the building (indoor positionting). Indoor positioning using WiFi has limits on location placement. To overcome these shortcomings are used sensor beacon bluetooth low energy with the advantages of having low power consumption and relatively small dimensions that can be placed in various places that are difficult to reach by WiFi. Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is a system for knowing the position of objects or people in a room by using radio waves, magnetic fields, or other sensors obtained by mobile devices. The indoor positioning method is divided into deterministic and probabilistic. Deterministic can determine the position faster by using measurement techniques such as Trilateration and Triangulation. Trilateration is a method for determining location with known three location information and device distance to each access point. This research used Trilateration method with measurement technique based on RSSI value. Based on the results of the test, RSSI of the beacon is strongly affected by objects that have thickness and density. In line of sight conditions, Android devices are able to receive signals properly and determine the location of the device using trilateration with quite accurate.},

abstract = {During the last years, the market of embedded vision-based systems has been growing at an accelerated rate. Virtual and augmented reality has the potential to become one of the most innovative technologies for the next decade. One of the most important aspects of these technologies is related to the spatial location of objects or people in defined environments, for which there are several techniques. One of the most widely used is based on visual marker recognition. The main problems of these approaches are related to the accuracy, the changing environments, the processing time, the operating range/distance and the price. The popularization of these technologies produces a pull effect toward the companies developing the best technology at the lowest price. This paper proposes a marker design and an algorithm to detect the markers under different ambient conditions, with a long range to be executed on embedded systems with low computational requirements. The proposed method reduces the existing problems in the state-of-the-art related to the use of different environments and conditions such as different distances or different illumination. Moreover, the requisites of the method are minimal to reduce the cost of deployment.},

abstract = {Many of the indoor applications like navigation, indoor localization, object tracking require an indoor map. Indoor environments are dynamic in nature because of the objects present in it. To capture the essence of the indoor environment, it is essential to perform an object level mapping of an indoor space. This is because an object has the potential to alter the map of an indoor environment. Mapping a huge indoor environment could prove to be costly in terms of time with high infrastructure dependency. This compels us to find a simple solution in terms of cost, time and reliability to build an indoor map. The proposed solution should have minimal infrastructure dependence, so that it can be used in situations like disaster and rapid response scenarios, where the available infrastructure is minimal and time is of essence. We propose a Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) based approach which performs an object level mapping of the indoor environment using a portable RFID reader, RFID Ultra High Frequency(UHF) passive tags and inertial navigation sensors(INS). This approach identifies each object in the indoor environment using one or more passive tags. A novel algorithm has been developed which accurately maps the objects present in the indoor space. It is easily scalable to map huge indoor environments and can be applied without any intensive manual labor or expensive equipments. Our experiments show that this approach generates object level indoor maps with high accuracy.},

abstract = {Indoor positioning system (IPS) is becoming more and more important and necessary in our daily life. Based on the IPS, we may develop a variety of location based services (LBS) such as navigation and orientation in large commercial centers, tracking and monitoring objects, or locating the elderly and children. With the development of new advanced technologies, the hand-held devices such as smart-phones and tablets have been widely used. These devices are all equipped with common sensors such as accelerometer, magnetic field, gyro and sound sensors. Therefore, the development of sensors-based positioning system is becoming practical and easy to implement while GPS or Cell-ID works inaccurately in the indoor environment. In this paper, we propose a solution and develop an application to position user's location in an indoor environment by pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and orientation. The proposed system just uses some available sensors of smart-phones: accelerometer sensor, gyro sensor and gravity sensor for PDR which detects steps as well as to measure the length and the orientation of his/her steps and then computes his/her location.},

abstract = {An indoor positioning system (IPS) is a technology employed to locate objects and people within a building scenario using signal processing or other sensory information. Ultra Wide Band (UWB) is a versatile wireless technology that can be employed as an IPS and has shown very good performances. UWB can be used in many scenarios and its effectiveness in through wall detection along with its excellent resolution for person localization is one of the best applications of Impulse Radio (IR) UWB. The main objective of this work is to propose a concept for intelligent radar systems employing UWB augmented by machine learning approaches to not only localize but understand the location of a person or target within a building. Although suitably developed UWB is excellent for obtaining localizing data it does not automatically understand what that location effectively means or where it is thus further methods are required to create meaningful data for end user appreciation. Learning from the huge amount of UWB signal data through Multi Class Support Vector Machine (MC-SVM) architecture enables a truly evolving scheme to both localize targets and identify them in a useful way. Statistical analysis of the experimental results supports the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new interaction metaphor we have termed "god-like interaction". This is a metaphor for improved communication of situational and navigational information between outdoor users, equipped with mobile augmented reality systems, and indoor users, equipped with tabletop projector display systems. Physical objects are captured by a series of cameras viewing a table surface indoors, the data is sent over a wireless network, and is then reconstructed at a real-world location for outdoor augmented reality users. Our novel god-like interaction metaphor allows users to communicate information using physical props as well as natural gestures. We have constructed a system that implements our god-like interaction metaphor as well as a series of novel applications to facilitate collaboration between indoor and outdoor users. We have extended a well-known video based rendering algorithm to make it suitable for use on outdoor wireless networks of limited bandwidth. This paper also describes the limitations and lessons learned during the design and construction of the hardware that supports this research.},

abstract = {Exact real-time pupil tracking is an important step in a live eye gaze. Since pupil centre is a base point's reference, exact eye centre localization is essential for many applications, such as face recognition and eye gaze estimation. A new method proposed in this paper is to extract pupil eye features exactly within different intensity levels of eye images, mostly with localization of determined interest objects and where the human is looking. As application area, the eye localization in the frame of a video-sequence has been chosen with continuing in iris and pupil detection. This method is fast and has a high degree of accuracy to determine the eye gaze after the pupil is detected because it depends on the features in the human eye. The intensity increases in the centre of the eye, and these features are extracted using a multistage algorithm. Firstly, the feature-based algorithm detected the location of the face region and will be used to detect the pupil on the face. Secondly, use the pupil to determine where humans are looking. Proposed algorithm experiments results to the faces show that they are not only robust, but also relatively efficient. It has been tested on the Mackup database, which contains 500 images belonging to 108 females from the Asian region with different indoor illuminations. The image from a real-world indoor setting with lenses, and images from the Internet. The experiment results show 99{\%}. This ratio shows very good robustness and accuracy.},

abstract = {Summary form only given. The main ideas of pervasive/ubiquitous computing include 1) the fusion of cyberspace and physical space, 2) the distraction-free computing. Context awareness is the effort for computer systems to sense and leverage the rich context information in the dual space. It has been recognized as a promising approach to reach the goal of invisibility, which can provide attentive service for user. As a basic service in the computing environment, context-aware service is with four basic functions of collecting, storing, reasoning and querying. The reasoning and inosculating module are for formal reasoning module; the context base module provides the function of storing data and querying; the querying and subscribing module gives the non-processing interface for upper application to request context service; the raw data acquiring module acquires the raw data from the sensors and profile files. Not only can the computing framework provide context common service, but it has favorable expansibility and adaptability. And, location-aware computing is a representative research area of context-aware computing. For which we proposed 1) a multi-object-tracking, highly-precise indoor positioning system, Cicada, to acquire the objects' location in smart space, 2) an expeditious and active location-aware service model, which not only to provide rapid location-related query service to applications, but also to offer the active spatial event service. As a showcase, based on the framework of context-aware service, the smart camera man module which is one part of the smart classroom project was ameliorated and satisfying result is retrieved. Smart camera man module implements the function that switching to the most convenient camera view in terms of the shift of the vision focus of smart classroom, which embodies the distraction-free characteristic of smart space apparently},

In these scenes, semantic segmentation methods have made huge advances in recent years. Such methods can provide useful prior information for object discovery by removing false positives and by delineating object boundaries. We propose a novel method that combines bottom-up object discovery and semantic priors for producing generic object candidates in RGB-D images. We use a deep learning method for semantic segmentation to classify colour and depth superpixels into meaningful categories. Separately for each category, we use saliency to estimate the location and scale of objects, and superpixels to find their precise boundaries. Finally, object candidates of all categories are combined and ranked. We evaluate our approach on the NYU Depth V2 dataset and show that we outperform other state-of-the-art object discovery methods in terms of recall.},

abstract = {Locating physical objects is a highly relevant application addressed by numerous systems. Many of these systems have a drawback that, costly infrastructure must be installed before a significant physical area can be covered, i.e. before these systems may be used in practice. In this paper, a new architecture for indoor localization is built on the ubiquitous infrastructure using sensors for locating objects. Mobile nodes as well as static nodes equipped with sensors, naturally omnipresent in populated environments, are the main elements of this system. This paper describes, the design of object search system to be presented together with a set of simple heuristics which can be used for efficient object search. The proposed system can locate each of the physical items in our home, which may randomly change their location. The location of a mobile node is frequently changing and its co-ordinates will be calculated based on the static nodes near to it. The location updates are frequently broadcasted and therefore all nodes will get location updates of all other nodes and it is easy to find the missing items. This system can only be successfully deployed, if environment conditions such as the density of the participant and its mobility and system settings such as number of static sensors used, allows us to find an object rapidly and efficiently. We therefore demonstrate the practicability of our system and obtain suitable system parameters for its execution using simulations.},

abstract = {Scene recognition and Object detection have made momentous progress lately. While mobile robotics and drone analysis has already reached its growth apex, for robots, which can interact with humans and the indoor environment, having a sense of discerning indoor scenes or interiors of a building is an added benefit. Although, many approaches have been proposed to detect objects and locations such as Indoor Positioning System (IPS), feature based, content based recognition systems etc., indoor scene recognition is yet to gain ground. This is quite justified since, unlike outdoor scenes, indoor scenes lack distinctive local or global visual substance patterns. This paper proposes a new technique of achieving this goal by considering the data from the scene's RGB and Depth images. With advancement in machine learning methodologies such as neural networks, deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, the workable accuracy in scene recognition is no longer hypothetical. A Deep CNN framework is used with a transfer learning approach for indoor scene recognition implemented on Tensor Flow (python), using the RGB as well as point cloud data i.e., RGB-D images. With this proposed system of deep CNN model, accuracy is able to reach up to 94.4{\%} on the indoor dataset. Further a comparison of the proposed model performance with that of the digits' GoogLeNet and AlexNet framework is conducted. Also a training of the algorithm on the benchmark NYUv2 dataset and have achieved an accuracy of 75.9{\%} which beats the highest accuracy obtained on that model (64.5{\%}).},

abstract = {GPS and GLONASS are used worldwide to locate the devices using satellites but it cannot locate objects under the roof. Therefore different sensors are required to be deployed inside for indoor localization of the devices. Different techniques have been developed including angle of arrival technique, triangulation, trilateration, Artificial Neural Networks, KNN Classification techniques and Bayesian classification techniques. One of the most popular technique known as Naive Bayes Technique is mostly used for indoor localization of the objects and devices. Naive Bayes classifier assumes conditional independence between the attributes but in real world this is not the case. In order to overcome dependence and zero probability issue of Naive Bayes algorithm, different variants of Naive Bayes technique have been developed. In this paper we have done a comparative study of different Naive Bayes theorem based classification techniques and some other classification techniques for location estimation of device in indoor environment are done. The accuracy and efficiency of different techniques including SVM, SMO, Random Forest, Random Trees, Augmented Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes, Fine Grained Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes technique are compared to find the best location estimation algorithm.},

abstract = {The egocentric perspective is a recent perspective brought by new devices like the GoPro and Google Glass, which are becoming more available to the public. The hands are the most consistent objects in the egocentric perspective and they can represent more information about people and their activities, but the nature of the perspective and the ever changing shape of the hands makes them difficult to detect. Previous work has focused on indoor environments or controlled data since it brings simpler ways to approach it, but in this work we use data with changing background and variable illumination, which makes it more challenging. We use a Deformable Part Model based approach to generate hand proposals since it can handle the many gestures the hand can adopt and rivals other techniques on locating the hands while reducing the number of proposals. We also use the location where the hands appear and size in the image to reduce the number of detections. Finally, a CNN classifier is applied to remove the final false positives to generate the hand detections.},

The global positioning system (GPS) is a classic system to locate people, vehicles and other objects. However the GPS signal cannot be received in closed space, so the localization can only be conducted through indoor positioning technologies. In this paper, we focus on the continuous positioning of people and vehicles in the tunnels. The ultra-wide-band (UWB) positioning technology is adopted, and we proposed a methods to remove the outliers to reduce the impact of NLOS transmissions. Moreover, we designed a continuous positioning algorithm based on prediction to increase the accuracy of positioning during the movement. Finally, an experimental platform was built, and the proposed scheme was evaluated. The experimental results show that the optimized algorithm can provide higher positioning accuracy and frequency than the traditional method.},

These systems are construct to attain location information of individuals and objects inside a building. Now a day all the applicable wireless technologies used in this context are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based. These advancements are additionally decided for their ease of use, low cost and integration into wireless devices. However, these techniques are having some positioning errors along with specified region. Here, we introduce another wireless technology named Light Fidelity (Li-Fi), the basic convention of this technology is the transfer of information using light illumination by light emitting diodes. This article primarily established a set of evaluation indexes for the performance of these three Wi-Fi, BLE and Li-Fi technologies in indoor positioning scenarios. We compare the predefined IPSs in term of performance and limitations. After then outline the tradeoffs among these systems from the perspective of all evaluation entities. We show experimentally that Li-Fi technology achieves a high efficiency but for accuracy, Wi-Fi is still better than Li-Fi and BLE technology.},

Given an image sequence, temporal dependencies of consecutive segmentation fields and spatial dependencies within each segmentation field are unified by a dynamic probabilistic framework based on the conditional random field (CRF). An efficient approximate filtering algorithm is derived for the DCRF model to recursively estimate the segmentation field from the history of observed images. The foreground and shadow segmentation method integrates both intensity and gradient features. Moreover, models of background, shadow, and gradient information are updated adaptively for nonstationary background processes. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can accurately detect moving objects and their cast shadows even in monocular grayscale video sequences.},

To accomplish some of these tasks, robots must be able to navigate intelligently from one location to another in dynamic indoor environments. The indoor navigation is a challenging task as many moving and movable objects can be found in the way, blocking the robot's path. D*Lite is a path planning algorithm that replans more efficiently in case the environment changes. However, depending on how blocked the robot is, replanned paths can be much longer than the original or, in the worst case, the target location can not be reached anymore. Therefore, we introduce an adaptation to D*Lite which allows robots to ask for human assistance to move objects on its surrounding when its path is blocked. The algorithm also computes whether and how long the robot can wait for help. Experiments were carried out using simulation and a real robot.},

Many researchers are referring to location estimation as a crucial component in numerous applications. There is no standard in indoor localisation thus the selection of an existing system needs to be done based on the environment being tracked, the accuracy and the precision required. Modern localisation systems use various techniques such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Time of Arrival (TOA), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Angle of Arrival (AOA). This paper is a survey of various active and passive localisation techniques developed over the years. The majority of the localisation techniques are part of the active systems class due to the necessity of tags/electronic devices carried by the person being tracked or mounted on objects in order to estimate their position. The second class called passive localisation represents the estimation of a person's position without the need for a physical device i.e. tags or sensors. The assessment of the localisation systems is based on the wireless technology used, positioning algorithm, accuracy and precision, complexity, scalability and costs.

abstract = {Wi-Fi based indoor positioning, which is based on attenuation of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is an emerging Location Based Service (LBS) technology. As positioning accuracy is sensitive to environmental factors, most of the existing algorithms based on experimental test perform badly without adaptation to dynamics of environment. In this paper, we propose an indoor positioning method by locating the representation of a cluster within similar environments. The K-Means algorithm is used to extract the similarities of the objects within the nearby area. To overcome the problem of parameter determination under the circumstances of lack of fingerprint and extra hardware, we proposed a Log-normal shadowing model (LNSM) with Artificial Neural Networks to estimate distance enabling the parameters to be dynamically adjusted according to the change of the environment. The experimental results of one day auto fair data demonstrate the performance of our method with a higher degree of accuracy than other methods.},

However, current RFID localization system cannot achieve the task of precise and highly accurate object localization due to the limitations of localization algorithm. Traditionally, the localization algorithm cannot make the localization more accuracy. The demand to improve the localization precision is still growing dramatically. LANDMARC system is a typical case that uses virtual tag to improve the overall accuracy of locating moving objects. However, this overall accuracy is fluctuates due to the multipath effect and the various indoor environment. This research work attempts to improve localization precision by using the sensing information network coordination and the log-distance path loss model.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an indoor action detection system which can automatically keep the log of users' activities of daily life since each activity generally consists of a number of actions. The hardware setting here adopts top-view depth cameras which makes our system less privacy sensitive and less annoying to the users, too. We regard the series of images of an action as a set of key-poses in images of the interested user which are arranged in a certain temporal order and use the latent SVM framework to jointly learn the appearance of the key-poses and the temporal locations of the key-poses. In this work, two kinds of features are proposed. The first is the histogram of depth difference value which can encode the shape of the human poses. The second is the location-signified feature which can capture the spatial relations among the person, floor, and other static objects. Moreover, we find that some incorrect detection results of certain type of action are usually associated with another certain type of action. Therefore, we design an algorithm that tries to automatically discover the action pairs which are the most difficult to be differentiable, and suppress the incorrect detection outcomes. To validate our system, experiments have been conducted, and the experimental results have shown effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper presents an effective jump-diffusion method for segmenting a range image and its associated reflectance image in the Bayesian framework. The algorithm works on complex real-world scenes (indoor and outdoor), which consist of an unknown number of objects (or surfaces) of various sizes and types, such as planes, conics, smooth surfaces, and cluttered objects (like trees and bushes). Formulated in the Bayesian framework, the posterior probability is distributed over a solution space with a countable number of subspaces of varying dimensions. The algorithm simulates Markov chains with both reversible jumps and stochastic diffusions to traverse the solution space. The reversible jumps realize the moves between subspaces of different dimensions, such as switching surface models and changing the number of objects. The stochastic Langevin equation realizes diffusions within each subspace. To achieve effective computation, the algorithm precomputes some importance proposal probabilities over multiple scales through Hough transforms, edge detection, and data clustering. The latter are used by the Markov chains for fast mixing. The algorithm is tested on 100 1D simulated data sets for performance analysis on both accuracy and speed. Then, the algorithm is applied to three data sets of range images under the same parameter setting. The results are satisfactory in comparison with manual segmentations.},

abstract = {Doris, the social robot girl, is under development to be employed in museums and trade fairs as a tour guide. External sensorial information must be inputted so that Doris moves around each new location by using landmark identification points that can improve the real localization of the robot in combination with an extended Kalman filter. Doris is equipped with a semantic map that contains several information points such as the building structure, sites that the robot must pass, features (obstacles) of the built environment, and landmark locations. Three additional sensors were installed on Doris: a laser range finder LMS-200, an omnidirectional Mobotix C25 camera, and an RFID system Speedway Revolution 220 by Impinj. The use of these sensors implies the use of different types of landmarks: 35-cm-high circular landmarks, placed on the ground and covered with a reflective laser-detectable material; markers similar to QR codes placed at 250 cm above the ground level that the omnidirectional camera can identify; and RFID detectable dogbone antennas. One contribution is to prove a simple methodology of localization by using sensor fusion with a semantic map, without mapping the whole environment by creating a point cloud map and without using the SLAM technique. Additionally, another contribution for the research is to define a good methodology for a precise sensors calibration. The initial results showed that each sensor functions efficiently, when using only the laser and the camera, due to the low accuracy of the RFID system alone. The final results show the behavior of the robot localization in the presence of people and different objects when both sensors are working at the same time. Occlusions may affect the reflective landmarks or visual markers. Therefore, the sensor fusion is implemented to achieve better robustness in the location estimation.},

The projected light consists of a sequence of gray code images which assigns each pixel in the projection area a unique gray code to distinguish their coordination. The light sensors installed on a toy cars and a potential "passenger" receive the light streams from the projected light, based on which their locations are inferred. The toy car then utilizes A* algorithm to plan a route based on its location, its orientation, the target's location and the map of "roads". The fast speed of projected light based localization technique enables the toy car to adjust its own orientation while "driving" and keep itself on "roads". The toy car system demonstrates that the localization technique and the client-server architecture can benefit similar applications that require fine-grained location information of multiple objects simultaneously.},

Salient regions are used to glue together the segments obtained from over-segmenting the scene by either color or depth segmentation algorithms, or by a combination of both. We suggest a late-fusion approach that first extracts segments from color and depth independently before fusing them to exploit that the data is complementary. Furthermore, we investigate several mechanisms for ranking the object candidates. We evaluate on one publicly available dataset and on one challenging sequence with a high degree of clutter.

Hence, this paper considers a novel indoor location system that aims to locate an object within an accuracy of about 2 cm using ordinary and inexpensive off-the-shelf devices and that was designed and tested in an office room to evaluate its performance. In order to compute the distance between the transducers (speakers) and object to be localized (microphone), time-of-arrival measurements of acoustic signals consisting of Binary Phase Shift Keying modulated Gold sequences are performed. This DS-CDMA scheme assures accurate distance measurements and provides immunity to noise and interference. Two methods have been proposed for location estimation. The first method takes the average of four location estimates obtained by trilateration technique. In the second method, only a single robust position estimate is obtained using three distances while the least reliable fourth distance measurement is not taken into account. The system's performance is evaluated at positions from two height levels using system parameters determined by preliminary experiments. The precision distributions in the work area and the precision versus accuracy plots depict the system performance. The proposed system provides location estimates of better than 2 cm accuracy with 99{\%} precision. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The RFID is not only a feasible, novel, and cost-effective candidate for the indoor location sensing but also considered as the bridge which can merge physical world with hyperspace. Our study focuses on a location-aware computing architecture which provides the scalable location-based services for tracking nearly all daily objects by utilizing the RFID tags. The paper presents a hierarchical structure to organize the position areas based on tracking zone of interest (TZOI). Because the context is vital for mobile computing and can enable the revolution in computing model, a method of managing the location-centric context record is brought forward. We further propose an approach to aware the object's intentions and requirements which are varying over location by tracing and matching these records. An original application experimenting on the baggage handling in the airport also demonstrates the location awareness, e.g., when the baggage has been automatically sorted and arrives the correct place, one SMS is delivered to the owner's mobile phone to remind him.},

abstract = {The wireless sensor network is an emerging technology that may greatly facilitate human life by providing ubiquitous sensing, computing, and communication capability. To be context-aware, one of the central issues in sensor networks is location tracking. The accurate location of objects in indoor environments is a key aspect of many applications such as resource management or security. Ubiquitous indoor environments often contain substantial amounts of metal and other such reflective materials that affect the propagation of radio frequency signals in non-trivial ways, causing severe multi-path effects, dead-spots, noise, and interference. This scheme is presenting a cheap and enhanced ranging technique rather than other existing technique by making a fusion of RSSI and LQI that is particularly well suited to support context-aware computing. The aim of the proposed system is to provide a low cost, simple technique based on RSSI and LQI values, provided by the ZigBee module, which also without considering any needs to change the system according to specific indoor environments. This paper considers the issues of a user's privacy, security, and an accurate and robust indoor RF location. The analytical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RF-based indoor location determination. {\textcopyright} 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {In this work we show how to reduce the computational cost of using Bayesian networks for localization. We investigate a range of Monte Carlo sampling strategies, including Gibbs and Metropolis. We found that for our Gibbs samplers, most of the time is spent in slice sampling. Moreover, our results show that although uniform sampling over the entire domain suffers occasional rejections, it has a much lower overall computational cost than approaches that carefully avoid rejections. The key reason for this efficiency is the flatness of the full conditionals in our localization networks. Our sampling technique is also attractive because it does not require extensive tuning to achieve good performance, unlike the Metropolis samplers. We demonstrate that our whole domain sampling technique converges accurately with low latency. On commodity hardware our sampler localizes up to 10 points in less than half a second, which is over 10 times faster than a common general-purpose Bayesian sampler. Our sampler also scales well, localizing 51 objects with no location information in the training set in less than 6 seconds. Finally, we present an analytic model that describes the number of evaluations per variable using slice sampling. The model allows us to analytically determine how flat a distribution should be so that whole domain sampling is computationally more efficient when compared to other methods},

The reasons of object monitoring are permanently changing and evolving, following the development of public and non-public sectors. For example using of various tags, stuck on goods, are used for goods identification in stores and for security reasons for many years. Further, the assets identification using passive tags turns to active identification enabling automatic inventorying and permanent assets protection at the same time. Active identification provides also the remote monitoring of objects, moreover, when object's data are safely shared on Internet environment, a number of cloud services can be enabled to allow customers remote monitoring of objects. Based on such ICT environment, the architecture called Internet of Things is ready to come to daily life. The objects considered in such systems can be home appliances, medical devices, building assets, computers, mobile devices, cars, production components, manufacturing tools, building materials and, of course, people. Especially the bindings and relations among objects, for example an identified person having an expensive identified device and passing unauthorized zone is evaluated as a risk transaction resulting to a denied access. Beside the object identification the differentiation of static and moving objects brings a new important parameter to improve the IoT concept.},

Obstacle detection and avoidance used an IR sensor to detect objects in the drone's path, allowing the drone to look for alternate paths. Pathfinding used a modified Node Array A* algorithm implemented in a 3D model of the testing area within the Unity engine. Finally, energy monitoring used the drone's built-in Python library to log voltage values and were sent to the Unity system, which reroutes the drone upon detecting a low battery voltage.

abstract = {Social interaction between animals may influence disease transmission paths. Therefore, the usage of real-time location systems gains in importance for livestock farms and research institutes as this technology helps to simultaneously obtain positions of a large number of animals and to evaluate them automatically. Thus, the aim of the project was to specify the accuracy of the real-time location system under practical conditions with regard to a possible future application. In practice, ear tags have proven their worth because pigs manipulate and therefore destroy other objects applied to them in the long term. Therefore, a real-time location system was used providing the sending unit integrated in an ear tag. Ear tags were tested in a sows' gestation stall in static positions. Measuring took place for 5 min per static position, whereas data was transmitted once per second (1 Hz) which led to 300 data points per position. Metal pen equipment led to lost or noisy positions. On average, 9{\%} of data losses occurred and were inserted for the following data evaluation. A Haar wavelet was applied to reduce the noise. Filter settings were rated with the help of an error size consisting of the Euclidean error and an error for the variance of the filtered signal. An optimal filter setting could be achieved when only the 29 largest coefficients for the X axis and 20 largest coefficients for the Y axis were kept while all others were set to 0. Additionally, a t-test was performed to test whether an averaged number of coefficients over all ear tags and an optimal individual filtering of each single ear tag resulted in a significantly different filter result. P-values of the t-test were 0.15 (X coordinate) and 0.18 (Y coordinate) and therefore not significant. Thus, an averaged filter setting can be applied to all ear tags. The median accuracy of measured data described as Euclidean distance was 2.7 m before filtering and improved to 2.0 m after filtering. Considering the results of this system investigation, it shows that the system may be helpful for ensuing studies regarding e.g. animal behaviour, movement profiles, or social networks to uncover possible transmission paths for diseases. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors},

Since Global Positioning system (GPS) relies on line of sight communications with a satellite transceiver, it does not work within buildings. To overcome this challenge, IPS technology could use RF based communication and locate humans and objects indoors. The key advantage of RF based communication is its high coverage range and non-line of sight communications. Wi-Fi finger printing is an efficient RF based technique for IPS which utilizes signal strength of wireless LAN to identify different indoor locations. In this paper, we develop an experimental testbed to implement Wi-Fi fingerprinting based IPS. We analyse the performance of Wi-Fi fingerprinting based IPS for three different indoor scenarios. Results show that Wi-Fi finger printing based IPS accurately predicts user location when the multi-path fading is low and access points are closer to the user.},
